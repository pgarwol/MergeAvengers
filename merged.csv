571,"00:35:56,400","00:35:58,687",nan,Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.,nan,,
572,"00:35:59,560","00:36:01,520",nan,And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us.,nan,,

609,"00:38:12,280","00:38:13,770",nan,And make them martyrs?,nan,,

627,"00:38:58,040","00:38:59,963",nan,But it doesn't go off.,nan,,
628,"00:39:02,000","00:39:03,650",nan,It just,nan,,
629,"00:39:04,160","00:39:06,083",nan,sits there in the rubble.,nan,,
630,"00:39:07,080","00:39:09,367",nan,Three feet from our faces.,nan,,
631,"00:39:10,440","00:39:13,925",nan,And on the side of the shell is painted one word.,nan,,

637,"00:39:38,800","00:39:42,566",nan,I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.,nan,,
638,"00:39:43,560","00:39:44,721",nan,Now I don't.,nan,,
639,"00:39:45,120","00:39:46,849",nan,We will make it right.,nan,,

931,"01:03:09,080","01:03:10,241",nan,Nat seems really shaken.,nan,,
932,"01:03:11,720","01:03:13,210",nan,Ultron has these allies.,nan,,
933,"01:03:13,320","01:03:17,250",nan,"These kids. They're punks, really.",nan,,
934,"01:03:18,960","01:03:21,406",nan,"But they carry a big, damn stick.",nan,,
935,"01:03:21,520","01:03:22,726",nan,And Nat took a serious hit.,nan,,
936,"01:03:23,920","01:03:26,400",nan,Someone's gonna have to teach them some manners.,nan,,
937,"01:03:26,600","01:03:28,409",nan,That someone being you.,nan,,
938,"01:03:29,720","01:03:32,564",nan,You know I totally support your avenging.,nan,,

942,"01:03:41,560","01:03:43,289",nan,You don't think they need me.,nan,,
943,"01:03:43,960","01:03:47,601",nan,"I think they do, which is a lot scarier.",nan,,
944,"01:03:48,760","01:03:50,569",nan,They're a mess.,nan,,
945,"01:03:51,560","01:03:52,561",nan,Yeah.,nan,,
946,"01:03:53,320","01:03:54,765",nan,I guess they're my mess.,nan,,
947,"01:03:56,320","01:03:57,924",nan,You need to be sure,nan,,

954,"01:04:32,160","01:04:34,003",nan,I can feel the difference.,nan,,
955,"01:04:46,960","01:04:49,645",nan,"Scream, and your entire staff dies.",nan,,
956,"01:04:51,560","01:04:53,801",nan,"I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met.",nan,,
957,"01:04:53,960","01:04:55,007",nan,I didn't.,nan,,
958,"01:04:55,160","01:04:56,650",nan,Do you expect a thankyou note?,nan,,
959,"01:04:56,800","01:04:58,484",nan,I expect you to know why.,nan,,
960,"01:04:59,920","01:05:01,206",nan,The Cradle.,nan,,
961,"01:05:01,280","01:05:03,203",nan,"This is the next thing, Tony.",nan,,
962,"01:05:03,360","01:05:06,330",nan,This is the next me.,nan,,
963,"01:05:06,720","01:05:09,291",nan,The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.,nan,,
964,"01:05:09,400","01:05:11,050",nan,It can't build a living body.,nan,,
965,"01:05:11,160","01:05:12,241",nan,It can. You can.,nan,,
966,"01:05:12,720","01:05:14,006",nan,You lack the materials.,nan,,
967,"01:05:16,440","01:05:17,805",nan,"You're a brilliant woman, Helen.",nan,,
968,"01:05:21,080","01:05:24,163",nan,But we all have room to improve.,nan,,
969,"01:05:45,960","01:05:48,361",nan,I didn't realise you were waiting.,nan,,
970,"01:05:48,480","01:05:52,883",nan,"I would've joined you, but it didn't seem like the right time.",nan,,
971,"01:05:53,840","01:05:55,922",nan,They used up all the hot water.,nan,,
972,"01:05:56,760","01:05:58,205",nan,I should've joined you.,nan,,
973,"01:05:58,360","01:06:00,010",nan,Missed our window.,nan,,
974,"01:06:00,800","01:06:02,040",nan,Did we?,nan,,
975,"01:06:05,600","01:06:06,726",nan,The world just saw the Hulk.,nan,,
976,"01:06:09,400","01:06:11,323",nan,"The real Hulk, for the first time.",nan,,
977,"01:06:14,560","01:06:17,211",nan,You know I have to leave.,nan,,
978,"01:06:14,560","01:06:17,211",nan,You assume that I have to stay?,nan,,
979,"01:06:19,280","01:06:21,931",nan,I had this dream.,nan,,
980,"01:06:22,280","01:06:26,720",nan,"The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake...",nan,,
981,"01:06:26,920","01:06:28,251",nan,What did you dream?,nan,,
982,"01:06:29,280","01:06:31,089",nan,That I was an Avenger.,nan,,
983,"01:06:33,120","01:06:36,927",nan,That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.,nan,,
984,"01:06:38,400","01:06:40,482",nan,I think you're being hard on yourself.,nan,,
985,"01:06:42,600","01:06:45,080",nan,Here I was hoping that was your job.,nan,,
986,"01:06:48,040","01:06:49,610",nan,What are you doing?,nan,,
987,"01:06:51,240","01:06:53,049",nan,I'm running with it.,nan,,
988,"01:06:54,360","01:06:55,964",nan,With you.,nan,,
989,"01:06:56,720","01:07:01,924",nan,"If running is the plan, as far as you want.",nan,,
990,"01:07:03,800","01:07:05,564",nan,Are you out of your mind?,nan,,
991,"01:07:10,920","01:07:12,331",nan,I want you to understand that...,nan,,
992,"01:07:12,440","01:07:16,405",nan,"Natasha, where can I go?",nan,,
993,"01:07:17,480","01:07:19,801",nan,Where in the world am I not a threat?,nan,,
994,"01:07:19,920","01:07:22,241",nan,You're not a threat to me.,nan,,
995,"01:07:19,920","01:07:22,241",nan,Are you sure?,nan,,
996,"01:07:23,160","01:07:24,969",nan,Even if I didn't just...,nan,,
997,"01:07:26,600","01:07:27,965",nan,There's no future with me.,nan,,
998,"01:07:29,640","01:07:30,641",nan,I can't ever...,nan,,
999,"01:07:30,880","01:07:33,121",nan,I can't have this.,nan,,
1000,"01:07:33,840","01:07:34,966",nan,Kids.,nan,,
1001,"01:07:35,440","01:07:38,011",nan,Do the math. I physically can't.,nan,,
1002,"01:07:39,760","01:07:41,205",nan,Neither can I.,nan,,
1003,"01:07:45,880","01:07:49,407",nan,In the Red Room where I was trained...,nan,,
1004,"01:07:49,880","01:07:55,971",nan,"Where I was raised, they have a graduation ceremony.",nan,,
1005,"01:07:57,600","01:07:59,409",nan,They sterilise you.,nan,,
1006,"01:08:02,640","01:08:04,051",nan,It's efficient.,nan,,
1007,"01:08:06,960","01:08:08,325",nan,One less thing to worry about.,nan,,
1008,"01:08:10,440","01:08:13,808",nan,The one thing that might matter more than a mission.,nan,,
1009,"01:08:16,160","01:08:18,049",nan,Makes everything easier.,nan,,
1010,"01:08:19,440","01:08:20,680",nan,Even killing.,nan,,
1011,"01:08:25,760","01:08:28,843",nan,You still think you're the only monster on the team?,nan,,
1012,"01:08:35,040","01:08:37,122",nan,"So, we disappear?",nan,,
1013,"01:08:43,800","01:08:45,640",nan,Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?,nan,,
1014,"01:08:46,480","01:08:49,006",nan,Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.,nan,,
1015,"01:08:50,120","01:08:52,168",nan,I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.,nan,,
1016,"01:08:52,280","01:08:54,282",nan,"Yeah, give him time.",nan,,
1017,"01:08:54,440","01:08:56,363",nan,We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.,nan,,
1018,"01:08:58,560","01:09:00,164",nan,Earth's mightiest heroes.,nan,,
1019,"01:09:00,320","01:09:01,924",nan,Pulled us apart like cotton candy.,nan,,
1020,"01:09:02,280","01:09:03,760",nan,Seems like you walked away all right.,nan,,
1021,"01:09:06,200","01:09:07,201",nan,Is that a problem?,nan,,
1022,"01:09:07,560","01:09:09,483",nan,I don't trust a guy without a dark side.,nan,,
1023,"01:09:10,680","01:09:11,727",nan,Call me oldfashioned.,nan,,
1024,"01:09:11,840","01:09:14,411",nan,"Well, let's just say you haven't seen it yet.",nan,,
1025,"01:09:14,720","01:09:16,927",nan,"You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?",nan,,
1026,"01:09:17,160","01:09:19,401",nan,"Well, I guess you'd know.",nan,,
1027,"01:09:19,520","01:09:20,806",nan,Whether you'd tell us is a bit of a question.,nan,,
1028,"01:09:20,960","01:09:22,086",nan,Banner and I were doing research.,nan,,
1029,"01:09:22,240","01:09:24,440",nan,That would affect the team.,nan,,
1030,"01:09:22,240","01:09:24,440",nan,That would end the team!,nan,,
1031,"01:09:24,680","01:09:25,761",nan,Isn't that the mission?,nan,,
1032,"01:09:25,960","01:09:27,200",nan,Isn't that the Why We Fight?,nan,,
1033,"01:09:27,320","01:09:29,561",nan,So we can end the fight.,nan,,
1034,"01:09:27,320","01:09:29,561",nan,So we get to go home!,nan,,
1035,"01:09:32,800","01:09:36,850",nan,"Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die.",nan,,
1036,"01:09:36,960","01:09:37,961",nan,Every time.,nan,,
1037,"01:09:40,440","01:09:42,841",nan,I'm sorry. Mr Stark...,nan,,
1038,"01:09:43,720","01:09:47,446",nan,"Clint said you wouldn't mind, but our tractor doesn't seem to want to start at all.",nan,,
1039,"01:09:47,760","01:09:50,120",nan,I thought maybe you might...,nan,,
1040,"01:09:47,760","01:09:50,120",nan,"Yeah, I'll give her a kick.",nan,,
1041,"01:09:53,560","01:09:55,130",nan,Don't take from my pile.,nan,,
1042,"01:10:05,360","01:10:06,521",nan,"Hello, Deere.",nan,,
1043,"01:10:09,400","01:10:10,811",nan,Tell me everything.,nan,,
1044,"01:10:12,040","01:10:13,405",nan,What ails you?,nan,,
1045,"01:10:13,640","01:10:14,641",nan,Do me a favour.,nan,,
1046,"01:10:16,920","01:10:18,809",nan,Try not to bring it to life.,nan,,
1047,"01:10:18,960","01:10:20,485",nan,"Why, Ms Barton, you little minx.",nan,,
1048,"01:10:20,840","01:10:23,366",nan,"I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?",nan,,
1049,"01:10:23,480","01:10:24,800",nan,Was she ever not working for you?,nan,,
1050,"01:10:24,880","01:10:26,370",nan,Artificial intelligence.,nan,,
1051,"01:10:27,400","01:10:29,050",nan,You never even hesitated.,nan,,
1052,"01:10:29,360","01:10:34,680",nan,"Look, it's been a really long day, like Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful.",nan,,
1053,"01:10:34,720","01:10:37,320",nan,Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.,nan,,

1056,"01:10:41,320","01:10:42,924",nan,I'm just an old man,nan,,
1057,"01:10:43,600","01:10:45,170",nan,who cares very much about you.,nan,,
1058,"01:10:48,040","01:10:49,849",nan,And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.,nan,,
1059,"01:10:51,680","01:10:52,806",nan,I saw it.,nan,,
1060,"01:10:53,000","01:10:54,570",nan,I didn't tell the team. How could I?,nan,,
1061,"01:10:55,840","01:10:57,683",nan,"I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.",nan,,

1063,"01:11:00,000","01:11:01,001",nan,Because of me.,nan,,
1064,"01:11:02,240","01:11:03,685",nan,I wasn't ready.,nan,,
1065,"01:11:05,160","01:11:06,571",nan,I didn't do all I could.,nan,,

1069,"01:11:13,920","01:11:16,207",nan,"Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.",nan,,
1070,"01:11:16,520","01:11:18,682",nan,The end of the path I started us on.,nan,,
1071,"01:11:19,560","01:11:21,800",nan,"You come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony.",nan,,

1073,"01:11:28,960","01:11:30,405",nan,I watched my friends die.,nan,,

1076,"01:11:36,560","01:11:39,086",nan,It wasn't the worst part.,nan,,
1077,"01:11:36,560","01:11:39,086",nan,The worst part,nan,,
1078,"01:11:40,120","01:11:41,406",nan,is that you didn't.,nan,,
1079,"01:11:48,120","01:11:49,201",nan,I'll see you tonight.,nan,,
1080,"01:11:51,960","01:11:53,246",nan,I like the look.,nan,,

1082,"01:11:57,280","01:11:58,327",nan,I need your help.,nan,,
1083,"01:11:58,560","01:11:59,561",nan,It's nice to be needed.,nan,,
1084,"01:11:59,960","01:12:01,325",nan,It's dangerous.,nan,,
1085,"01:12:01,960","01:12:03,689",nan,I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.,nan,,
1086,"01:12:06,600","01:12:09,922",nan,Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time.,nan,,
1087,"01:12:10,280","01:12:13,250",nan,My contacts all say he's building something.,nan,,
1088,"01:12:13,360","01:12:17,570",nan,"The amount of vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.",nan,,
1089,"01:12:17,680","01:12:19,011",nan,What about Ultron himself?,nan,,
1090,"01:12:19,120","01:12:21,487",nan,He's easy to track. He's everywhere.,nan,,
1091,"01:12:21,920","01:12:24,287",nan,The guy is multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.,nan,,
1092,"01:12:24,960","01:12:27,770",nan,"It still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans, though.",nan,,
1093,"01:12:28,000","01:12:29,081",nan,Is he still going after launch codes?,nan,,
1094,"01:12:29,360","01:12:30,725",nan,"Yes, he is.",nan,,
1095,"01:12:30,840","01:12:32,330",nan,But he's not making any headway.,nan,,
1096,"01:12:32,440","01:12:34,522",nan,I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.,nan,,
1097,"01:12:34,640","01:12:37,246",nan,"Well, I contacted our friends at the Nexus about that.",nan,,

1101,"01:12:42,520","01:12:43,567",nan,Fastest access on Earth.,nan,,
1102,"01:12:43,720","01:12:44,767",nan,"So, what did they say?",nan,,
1103,"01:12:45,000","01:12:46,764",nan,He's fixated on the missiles.,nan,,
1104,"01:12:47,000","01:12:48,680",nan,But the codes are constantly being changed.,nan,,

1285,"01:24:43,240","01:24:45,322",nan,You might wish you hadn't asked that.,nan,,
1286,"01:24:58,120","01:24:59,849",nan,"Please, don't do this.",nan,,
1287,"01:25:00,360","01:25:01,930",nan,What choice do we have?,nan,,
1288,"01:25:10,200","01:25:11,201",nan,I lost him!,nan,,

1299,"01:26:29,320","01:26:30,651",nan,I'm fine.,nan,,
1300,"01:26:30,760","01:26:32,444",nan,I just need to take a minute.,nan,,
1301,"01:26:32,920","01:26:34,809",nan,I'm very tempted not to give you one.,nan,,
1302,"01:26:34,960","01:26:36,849",nan,The Cradle. Did you get it?,nan,,
1303,"01:26:37,040","01:26:38,530",nan,Stark will take care of it.,nan,,
1304,"01:26:39,920","01:26:40,921",nan,"No, he won't.",nan,,
1305,"01:26:44,440","01:26:46,727",nan,You don't know what you're talking about. Stark's not crazy.,nan,,

1309,"01:26:57,960","01:26:59,086",nan,Anyone on comms.,nan,,
1310,"01:26:59,200","01:27:00,645",nan,Ultron can't tell the difference,nan,,
1311,"01:27:00,800","01:27:03,121",nan,between saving the world and destroying it.,nan,,
1312,"01:27:05,040","01:27:07,486",nan,Where do you think he gets that?,nan,,
1313,"01:27:09,680","01:27:11,250",nan,Anything on Nat?,nan,,
1314,"01:27:09,680","01:27:11,250",nan,I haven't heard.,nan,,
1315,"01:27:11,360","01:27:13,727",nan,"But she's alive, or Ultron would be rubbing our faces in it.",nan,,
1316,"01:27:13,840","01:27:15,171",nan,This is sealed tight.,nan,,
1317,"01:27:15,320","01:27:18,803",nan,"We're gonna need to access the program, break it down from within.",nan,,
1318,"01:27:20,040","01:27:22,766",nan,Any chance Natasha might leave you a message outside the Internet?,nan,,
1319,"01:27:22,880","01:27:23,927",nan,Oldschool spy stuff?,nan,,
1320,"01:27:24,400","01:27:26,209",nan,There are some nets I can cast.,nan,,
1321,"01:27:26,320","01:27:27,560",nan,"Yeah, I'll find her.",nan,,
1322,"01:27:30,160","01:27:31,924",nan,I can work on tissue degeneration,nan,,
1323,"01:27:32,040","01:27:35,249",nan,if you could fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.,nan,,
1324,"01:27:35,400","01:27:36,526",nan,"Yeah, about that.",nan,,
1325,"01:27:40,960","01:27:41,961",nan,No.,nan,,
1326,"01:27:42,160","01:27:44,003",nan,You have to trust me.,nan,,
1327,"01:27:42,160","01:27:44,003",nan,Kind of don't.,nan,,
1328,"01:27:44,160","01:27:51,161",nan,"Our ally, the guy protecting the military's nuclear codes, I found him.",nan,,
1329,"01:27:51,240","01:27:52,366",nan,"Hello, Dr Banner.",nan,,
1330,"01:27:53,240","01:27:55,481",nan,Ultron didn't go after Jarvis because he was angry.,nan,,
1331,"01:27:56,080","01:27:59,687",nan,He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do.,nan,,
1332,"01:28:00,840","01:28:02,490",nan,So Jarvis went underground.,nan,,
1333,"01:28:02,600","01:28:04,090",nan,"Scattered, dumped his memory.",nan,,
1334,"01:28:04,680","01:28:06,170",nan,But not his protocols.,nan,,
1335,"01:28:06,600","01:28:10,047",nan,He didn't even know he was in there until I pieced him together.,nan,,
1336,"01:28:12,880","01:28:17,681",nan,"So, you want me to help you put Jarvis into this thing?",nan,,
1337,"01:28:17,800","01:28:19,564",nan,No! Of course not.,nan,,
1338,"01:28:19,720","01:28:21,404",nan,I wanna help you put Jarvis in this thing.,nan,,
1339,"01:28:23,800","01:28:25,450",nan,"We're out of my field, here.",nan,,
1340,"01:28:25,560","01:28:27,562",nan,You know bioorganics better than anyone.,nan,,
1341,"01:28:27,880","01:28:30,770",nan,And you just assume that Jarvis's operational matrix,nan,,
1342,"01:28:30,880","01:28:32,325",nan,can beat Ultron's?,nan,,
1343,"01:28:32,440","01:28:35,728",nan,Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it.,nan,,
1344,"01:28:35,880","01:28:36,881",nan,This is the opportunity.,nan,,
1345,"01:28:36,960","01:28:38,724",nan,We can create Ultron's perfect self,nan,,
1346,"01:28:38,880","01:28:42,362",nan,without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality.,nan,,
1347,"01:28:42,480","01:28:44,562",nan,We have to.,nan,,
1348,"01:28:42,480","01:28:44,562",nan,I believe it's worth a go.,nan,,
1349,"01:28:47,160","01:28:48,241",nan,I'm in a loop!,nan,,
1350,"01:28:48,400","01:28:51,370",nan,I'm caught in a time loop.,nan,,
1351,"01:28:48,400","01:28:51,370",nan,This is exactly where it all went wrong.,nan,,
1352,"01:28:51,480","01:28:53,400",nan,I know. I know. I know what everyone's gonna say.,nan,,
1353,"01:28:53,480","01:28:55,448",nan,But they're already saying it.,nan,,
1354,"01:28:56,000","01:28:57,161",nan,We're mad scientists.,nan,,
1355,"01:28:57,920","01:29:00,651",nan,"We're monsters, buddy.",nan,,
1356,"01:28:57,920","01:29:00,651",nan,We've gotta own it.,nan,,
1357,"01:29:01,640","01:29:02,880",nan,Make a stand.,nan,,
1358,"01:29:08,280","01:29:09,770",nan,It's not a loop.,nan,,
1359,"01:29:11,000","01:29:12,764",nan,It's the end of the line.,nan,,
1360,"01:29:33,280","01:29:35,408",nan,I wasn't sure you would wake up.,nan,,
1361,"01:29:35,520","01:29:38,967",nan,I hoped you would.,nan,,
1362,"01:29:35,520","01:29:38,967",nan,I wanted to show you.,nan,,
1363,"01:29:39,120","01:29:40,804",nan,I don't have anyone else.,nan,,
1364,"01:29:43,640","01:29:47,247",nan,I think a lot about meteors.,nan,,
1365,"01:29:43,640","01:29:47,247",nan,The purity in them.,nan,,
1366,"01:29:47,400","01:29:48,925",nan,Boom! The end.,nan,,
1367,"01:29:49,400","01:29:50,811",nan,Start again.,nan,,
1368,"01:29:50,960","01:29:52,928",nan,The world made clean,nan,,

1370,"01:29:55,680","01:29:57,808",nan,I was meant to be new.,nan,,
1371,"01:29:58,680","01:30:01,286",nan,I was meant to be beautiful.,nan,,
1372,"01:30:01,840","01:30:03,968",nan,The world would have looked to the sky,nan,,
1373,"01:30:04,080","01:30:07,011",nan,"and seen hope, seen mercy.",nan,,
1374,"01:30:07,800","01:30:09,882",nan,"Instead, they'll look up in horror",nan,,
1375,"01:30:10,000","01:30:11,331",nan,because of you.,nan,,
1376,"01:30:11,520","01:30:13,329",nan,You've wounded me.,nan,,
1377,"01:30:14,000","01:30:15,684",nan,I give you full marks for that.,nan,,
1378,"01:30:16,320","01:30:19,244",nan,"But, like the man said, what doesn't kill me...",nan,,
1379,"01:30:24,480","01:30:25,811",nan,...just makes me stronger.,nan,,

1396,"01:31:34,720","01:31:37,087",nan,This isn't a game!,nan,,

1437,"01:34:59,440","01:35:00,965",nan,Is it?,nan,,

1461,"01:36:12,000","01:36:16,442",nan,"I'm not what you are, and not what you intended.",nan,,
1462,"01:36:17,200","01:36:19,680",nan,"So, there may be no way to make you trust me.",nan,,
1463,"01:36:19,960","01:36:21,371",nan,But we need to go.,nan,,
1464,"01:36:36,160","01:36:37,321",nan,Right.,nan,,
1465,"01:36:37,960","01:36:39,200",nan,Well done.,nan,,
1466,"01:36:40,960","01:36:42,007",nan,Three minutes.,nan,,
1467,"01:36:42,720","01:36:44,370",nan,Get what you need.,nan,,
1468,"01:37:00,200","01:37:01,247",nan,"Good evening, boss.",nan,,
1469,"01:37:06,400","01:37:08,084",nan,No way we all get through this.,nan,,
1470,"01:37:08,200","01:37:10,280",nan,"If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost.",nan,,
1471,"01:37:11,000","01:37:12,440",nan,There's gonna be blood on the floor.,nan,,
1472,"01:37:12,480","01:37:13,891",nan,I got no plans tomorrow night.,nan,,
1473,"01:37:14,000","01:37:15,320",nan,I get first crack at the big guy.,nan,,
1474,"01:37:15,760","01:37:17,250",nan,Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.,nan,,
1475,"01:37:17,360","01:37:19,761",nan,That's true. He hates you the most.,nan,,
1476,"01:37:25,080","01:37:27,242",nan,Ultron knows we're coming.,nan,,
1477,"01:37:27,520","01:37:29,727",nan,Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.,nan,,
1478,"01:37:30,240","01:37:31,969",nan,And that's what we signed up for.,nan,,
1479,"01:37:32,240","01:37:34,766",nan,"But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.",nan,,
1480,"01:37:35,880","01:37:37,370",nan,So our priority,nan,,
1481,"01:37:38,080","01:37:39,161",nan,is getting them out.,nan,,
1482,"01:37:39,400","01:37:42,324",nan,We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!,nan,,
1483,"01:37:50,120","01:37:51,565",nan,Get off your asses.,nan,,
1484,"01:37:52,800","01:37:54,723",nan,All they want is to live their lives in peace.,nan,,
1485,"01:37:55,280","01:37:56,640",nan,And that's not gonna happen today.,nan,,
1486,"01:37:58,280","01:38:00,009",nan,But we can do our best to protect them.,nan,,
1487,"01:38:00,720","01:38:02,245",nan,And we can get the job done.,nan,,
1488,"01:38:05,640","01:38:12,803",nan,"We find out what Ultron's been building, we find Romanoff, and we clear the field.",nan,,
1489,"01:38:14,240","01:38:16,163",nan,Keep the fight between us.,nan,,
1490,"01:38:22,880","01:38:25,281",nan,Ultron thinks we're monsters.,nan,,
1491,"01:38:25,800","01:38:28,201",nan,That we're what's wrong with the world.,nan,,
1492,"01:38:28,320","01:38:30,641",nan,This isn't just about beating him.,nan,,
1493,"01:38:31,160","01:38:33,208",nan,It's about whether he's right.,nan,,
1494,"01:38:39,680","01:38:40,727",nan,Natasha!,nan,,
1495,"01:38:41,840","01:38:42,841",nan,Natasha!,nan,,
1496,"01:38:43,000","01:38:44,081",nan,Bruce?,nan,,
1497,"01:38:45,520","01:38:46,521",nan,You all right?,nan,,
1498,"01:38:46,680","01:38:47,727",nan,Yeah.,nan,,
1499,"01:38:47,840","01:38:49,569",nan,The team is in the city.,nan,,
1500,"01:38:47,840","01:38:49,569",nan,It's about to light up.,nan,,
1501,"01:38:49,680","01:38:51,840",nan,I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere.,nan,,
1502,"01:38:52,160","01:38:54,288",nan,Yeah. I did.,nan,,
1503,"01:39:00,680","01:39:01,841",nan,So what's our play?,nan,,
1504,"01:39:02,040","01:39:03,405",nan,I'm here to get you to safety.,nan,,
1505,"01:39:04,160","01:39:06,686",nan,Job's not finished.,nan,,
1506,"01:39:04,160","01:39:08,683",nan,"We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians.",nan,,
1507,"01:39:10,040","01:39:11,201",nan,And you've done plenty.,nan,,
1508,"01:39:13,600","01:39:15,090",nan,Our fight is over.,nan,,
1509,"01:39:16,480","01:39:18,721",nan,"So, we just disappear?",nan,,
1510,"01:39:22,880","01:39:24,723",nan,Come on.,nan,,
1511,"01:39:29,520","01:39:31,761",nan,"Your man's in the church, boss.",nan,,
1512,"01:39:31,880","01:39:33,723",nan,I think he's waiting for you.,nan,,
1513,"01:39:37,800","01:39:39,848",nan,Come to confess your sins?,nan,,
1514,"01:39:39,960","01:39:41,200",nan,I don't know. How much time you got?,nan,,
1515,"01:39:41,360","01:39:42,850",nan,More than you.,nan,,
1516,"01:39:45,240","01:39:48,050",nan,Have you been juicing?,nan,,
1517,"01:39:45,240","01:39:48,050",nan,Little vibranium cocktail?,nan,,
1518,"01:39:48,160","01:39:50,447",nan,You're looking...,nan,,
1519,"01:39:48,160","01:39:50,447",nan,I don't wanna say puffy.,nan,,
1520,"01:39:50,560","01:39:52,289",nan,You're stalling to protect the people.,nan,,
1521,"01:39:52,680","01:39:55,524",nan,"Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?",nan,,
1522,"01:39:55,840","01:39:58,320",nan,I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free.,nan,,
1523,"01:40:03,080","01:40:04,127",nan,What?,nan,,
1524,"01:40:05,040","01:40:07,361",nan,You think you were the only one stalling?,nan,,
1525,"01:40:08,080","01:40:09,730",nan,There's the rest of the vibranium.,nan,,
1526,"01:40:09,840","01:40:11,251",nan,"Function, still unclear.",nan,,
1527,"01:40:11,440","01:40:12,601",nan,"This is how you end, Tony.",nan,,
1528,"01:40:13,880","01:40:15,644",nan,This is peace in my time.,nan,,
1529,"01:40:32,360","01:40:33,407",nan,Go!,nan,,
1530,"01:40:38,960","01:40:40,291",nan,Get off the bridge!,nan,,
1531,"01:40:44,440","01:40:45,441",nan,Run!,nan,,
1532,"01:40:47,440","01:40:49,249",nan,Ultron.,nan,,

1534,"01:40:56,200","01:40:58,487",nan,They really did take everything from me.,nan,,
1535,"01:40:58,640","01:41:00,688",nan,You set the terms.,nan,,
1536,"01:40:58,640","01:41:00,688",nan,You can change them.,nan,,
1537,"01:41:00,800","01:41:02,040",nan,All right.,nan,,
1538,"01:41:26,240","01:41:27,480",nan,"Friday, the Vision?",nan,,
1539,"01:41:27,640","01:41:29,800",nan,"Boss, it's working.",nan,,
1540,"01:41:27,640","01:41:29,800",nan,He's burning Ultron out of the net.,nan,,
1541,"01:41:29,840","01:41:31,040",nan,He won't escape through there.,nan,,
1542,"01:41:36,120","01:41:37,451",nan,You shut me out.,nan,,
1543,"01:41:37,920","01:41:39,126",nan,You think I care?,nan,,
1544,"01:41:41,120","01:41:44,929",nan,"You take away my world, I take away yours.",nan,,
1545,"01:42:29,480","01:42:30,686",nan,Friday.,nan,,
1546,"01:42:30,800","01:42:33,246",nan,Sokovia is going for a ride.,nan,,

1548,"01:42:47,720","01:42:49,245",nan,the beauty of it?,nan,,
1549,"01:42:49,840","01:42:51,683",nan,The inevitability.,nan,,
1550,"01:42:51,920","01:42:55,163",nan,"You rise, only to fall.",nan,,
1551,"01:42:57,920","01:43:00,764",nan,"You, Avengers, you are my meteor.",nan,,
1552,"01:43:01,680","01:43:03,409",nan,My swift and terrible sword.,nan,,
1553,"01:43:03,600","01:43:05,090",nan,And the earth will crack,nan,,
1554,"01:43:05,280","01:43:07,203",nan,with the weight of your failure.,nan,,
1555,"01:43:08,880","01:43:12,646",nan,"Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me.",nan,,
1556,"01:43:13,120","01:43:14,531",nan,It means nothing.,nan,,

1565,"01:44:06,600","01:44:08,011",nan,I really hope this makes us even.,nan,,
1566,"01:44:10,320","01:44:12,368",nan,Now go be a hero.,nan,,
1567,"01:44:20,840","01:44:22,763",nan,The vibranium core's got a magnetic field.,nan,,
1568,"01:44:22,920","01:44:24,922",nan,That's what's keeping the rock together.,nan,,
1569,"01:44:25,040","01:44:26,087",nan,If it drops?,nan,,
1570,"01:44:26,160","01:44:27,491",nan,"Right now, the impact will kill thousands.",nan,,
1571,"01:44:27,560","01:44:30,291",nan,Once it gets high enough?,nan,,
1572,"01:44:27,560","01:44:30,291",nan,Global extinction.,nan,,
1573,"01:44:34,600","01:44:36,682",nan,That building's not clear. The 10th floor.,nan,,
1574,"01:44:41,560","01:44:42,561",nan,Hi.,nan,,
1575,"01:44:43,680","01:44:46,047",nan,Okay. Get in the tub!,nan,,

1584,"01:45:56,920","01:45:58,684",nan,How could I let this happen?,nan,,
1585,"01:45:58,800","01:46:00,848",nan,"Hey, hey, you okay?",nan,,
1586,"01:45:58,800","01:46:00,848",nan,This is all our fault.,nan,,
1587,"01:46:01,040","01:46:03,240",nan,"Hey, look at me.",nan,,
1588,"01:46:01,040","01:46:03,240",nan,"It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.",nan,,
1589,"01:46:03,280","01:46:04,327",nan,Who cares?,nan,,
1590,"01:46:04,440","01:46:05,965",nan,Are you up for this?,nan,,
1591,"01:46:06,080","01:46:07,161",nan,Are you?,nan,,
1592,"01:46:07,400","01:46:10,807",nan,"Look, I just need to know.",nan,,
1593,"01:46:07,400","01:46:10,807",nan,Because the city is flying.,nan,,
1594,"01:46:11,120","01:46:17,126",nan,"Okay. Look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow.",nan,,
1595,"01:46:17,280","01:46:18,361",nan,None of this makes sense.,nan,,
1596,"01:46:21,640","01:46:23,768",nan,But I'm going back out there because it's my job.,nan,,
1597,"01:46:24,640","01:46:27,291",nan,Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.,nan,,

1601,"01:46:34,280","01:46:36,920",nan,I'll send your brother to come find you.,nan,,
1602,"01:46:36,960","01:46:40,721",nan,"But if you step out that door, you are an Avenger.",nan,,
1603,"01:46:45,600","01:46:47,409",nan,All right. Good chat.,nan,,
1604,"01:46:51,160","01:46:52,207",nan,"Yeah, the city is flying.",nan,,
1605,"01:47:26,200","01:47:27,361",nan,I got you!,nan,,
1606,"01:47:27,680","01:47:28,920",nan,Just look at me!,nan,,
1607,"01:47:35,680","01:47:37,011",nan,You can't save them all.,nan,,
1608,"01:47:38,360","01:47:39,407",nan,You'll never...,nan,,
1609,"01:47:40,680","01:47:43,126",nan,Never what? You didn't finish!,nan,,
1610,"01:47:46,880","01:47:48,450",nan,"What, were you napping?",nan,,
1611,"01:48:09,920","01:48:11,001",nan,Thor.,nan,,
1612,"01:48:13,600","01:48:15,204",nan,You're bothering me.,nan,,

1617,"01:48:59,400","01:49:01,482",nan,"Keep up, old man!",nan,,
1618,"01:49:03,240","01:49:04,765",nan,Nobody would know.,nan,,
1619,"01:49:05,600","01:49:06,647",nan,Nobody.,nan,,
1620,"01:49:08,600","01:49:11,524",nan,"The last I saw him, an Ultron was sitting on him.",nan,,
1621,"01:49:11,640","01:49:13,529",nan,"Yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard.",nan,,
1622,"01:49:13,600","01:49:14,601",nan,I miss him already.,nan,,
1623,"01:49:30,160","01:49:31,321",nan,Hold your fire!,nan,,
1624,"01:49:41,200","01:49:42,247",nan,Romanoff!,nan,,
1625,"01:49:42,760","01:49:43,761",nan,Thanks!,nan,,
1626,"01:49:53,160","01:49:54,764",nan,The antigravs are rigged to flip.,nan,,
1627,"01:49:54,880","01:49:57,042",nan,"Touch them, they'll go full reverse thrust.",nan,,
1628,"01:49:57,160","01:49:58,605",nan,The city's not coming down slow.,nan,,
1629,"01:49:58,720","01:49:59,846",nan,Spire is vibranium.,nan,,
1630,"01:49:59,960","01:50:01,086",nan,If I get Thor to hit it...,nan,,
1631,"01:50:01,360","01:50:02,725",nan,It will crack. That's not enough.,nan,,
1632,"01:50:02,840","01:50:04,365",nan,The impact would still be devastating.,nan,,
1633,"01:50:04,520","01:50:05,880",nan,Maybe if we can cap the other end.,nan,,
1634,"01:50:06,040","01:50:07,690",nan,Keep the atomic action doubling back.,nan,,
1635,"01:50:07,840","01:50:09,205",nan,That could vaporise the city.,nan,,
