201,Tony Stark,"Actually, he's the boss.","00:15:04,840","00:15:05,966"
202,Tony Stark,I just pay for everything,"00:15:06,080","00:15:08,481"

238,Tony Stark,so let's make the most of it.,"00:16:35,160","00:16:37,083"

240,Bruce Banner,and compositional analysis.,"00:16:37,240","00:16:40,767"
241,Tony Stark,The sceptre is alien.,"00:16:41,920","00:16:43,922"
242,Tony Stark,There are elements I can't quantify.,"00:16:44,080","00:16:46,082"
243,Tony Stark,So there's elements you can?,"00:16:46,200","00:16:47,611"
244,Tony Stark,The jewel appears to be,"00:16:47,760","00:16:49,762"
245,Bruce Banner,a protective housing,"00:16:47,760","00:16:49,762"
246,Tony Stark,"for something inside,","00:16:49,880","00:16:51,325"
247,Tony Stark,something powerful.,"00:16:51,440","00:16:52,771"
248,Tony Stark,Like a reactor?,"00:16:52,880","00:16:53,961"

250,Tony Stark,I believe I'm deciphering code.,"00:16:55,440","00:16:57,602"
251,Tony Stark,Are you sure he's gonna be okay?,"00:16:59,920","00:17:01,490"
252,JARVIS,Pretending to need this guy,"00:17:02,800","00:17:05,160"
253,JARVIS,really brings the team together.,"00:17:02,800","00:17:05,160"
254,Tony Stark,There's,"00:17:05,280","00:17:07,760"
255,JARVIS,no possibility of deterioration.,"00:17:05,280","00:17:07,760"

257,Ultron,is instantaneous.,"00:17:07,960","00:17:11,043"

259,JARVIS,they're bonding with simulacra.,"00:17:11,160","00:17:13,200"
260,JARVIS,She's creating tissue.,"00:17:13,280","00:17:15,169"
261,JARVIS,"If you brought him to my lab,","00:17:15,280","00:17:16,691"
262,Ultron,the Regeneration Cradle,"00:17:16,800","00:17:19,406"
263,JARVIS,could do this in 20 minutes.,"00:17:16,800","00:17:19,406"
264,JARVIS,He's flat-lining. Call it. Time?,"00:17:19,520","00:17:21,443"
265,Ultron,"No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.","00:17:21,640","00:17:24,007"
266,Ultron,- I'm gonna be made of plastic.,"00:17:24,120","00:17:27,131"
267,JARVIS,- Here's your beverage.,"00:17:24,120","00:17:27,131"
268,JARVIS,"You'll be made of you, Mr Barton.","00:17:27,240","00:17:28,969"
269,JARVIS,Your own girlfriend,"00:17:29,120","00:17:30,690"
270,JARVIS,won't be able to tell the difference.,"00:17:29,120","00:17:30,690"

272,Ultron,That I can't fix.,"00:17:32,040","00:17:33,326"
273,Ultron,"This is the next thing, Tony.","00:17:34,160","00:17:36,128"
274,JARVIS,Your clunky metal suits,"00:17:36,320","00:17:38,440"
275,Ultron,are gonna be left in the dust.,"00:17:36,320","00:17:38,440"
276,Ultron,That is exactly the plan.,"00:17:38,480","00:17:40,209"
277,Ultron,"And, Helen, I expect to see you","00:17:41,160","00:17:44,004"
278,Tony Stark,at the party on Saturday.,"00:17:41,160","00:17:44,004"
279,Ultron,"Unlike you,","00:17:44,160","00:17:46,561"
280,JARVIS,I don't have a lot of time for parties.,"00:17:44,160","00:17:46,561"
281,Ultron,Will Thor be there?,"00:17:48,040","00:17:49,804"
282,Ultron,- What's the rumpus?,"00:17:51,880","00:17:54,326"
283,JARVIS,"- Well, the sceptre.","00:17:51,880","00:17:54,326"
284,JARVIS,"You see, we were wondering","00:17:55,520","00:17:59,127"
285,Ultron,how Strucker got so inventive.,"00:17:55,520","00:17:59,127"
286,JARVIS,So I've been analysing the gem inside.,"00:17:59,240","00:18:03,165"
287,Ultron,You may recognise...,"00:18:03,720","00:18:05,688"
288,JARVIS,- Jarvis.,"00:18:07,160","00:18:08,525"
289,JARVIS,- Doctor.,"00:18:07,160","00:18:08,525"
290,James Rhodes,"Started out,","00:18:09,280","00:18:12,602"
291,James Rhodes,Jarvis was just a natural language UI.,"00:18:09,280","00:18:12,602"
292,James Rhodes,Now he runs the Iron Legion.,"00:18:12,720","00:18:13,840"
293,James Rhodes,He runs more of the business,"00:18:14,320","00:18:18,007"
294,James Rhodes,than anyone besides Pepper.,"00:18:14,320","00:18:18,007"
295,James Rhodes,- Top of the line.,"00:18:18,120","00:18:19,246"
296,Thor,- Yes.,"00:18:18,120","00:18:19,246"
297,James Rhodes,I suspect not for long.,"00:18:19,360","00:18:20,646"
298,Thor,Meet the competition.,"00:18:21,840","00:18:22,921"
299,Thor,- It's beautiful.,"00:18:29,040","00:18:30,201"
300,James Rhodes,"- If you had to guess,","00:18:29,040","00:18:30,201"
301,James Rhodes,- what's it look like it's doing?,"00:18:30,320","00:18:33,324"
302,James Rhodes,- Like it's thinking.,"00:18:30,320","00:18:33,324"
303,Tony Stark,"I mean, this could be...","00:18:34,080","00:18:35,889"
304,Maria Hill,It's not a human mind.,"00:18:36,320","00:18:38,402"
305,Maria Hill,"I mean, look at this.","00:18:38,640","00:18:40,529"
306,Tony Stark,They're like neurons firing.,"00:18:40,720","00:18:42,882"
307,Thor,"Down in Strucker's lab, I saw","00:18:43,480","00:18:46,563"
308,Thor,some fairly advanced robotics work.,"00:18:43,480","00:18:46,563"
309,Tony Stark,"They deep-sixed the data,","00:18:47,680","00:18:50,251"
310,Tony Stark,but I gotta guess he was,"00:18:50,360","00:18:53,489"
311,Thor,knocking on a very particular door.,"00:18:50,360","00:18:53,489"
312,Maria Hill,Artificial intelligence.,"00:18:55,440","00:18:56,771"
313,Maria Hill,"This could be it, Bruce.","00:18:59,760","00:19:02,650"
314,Maria Hill,This could be the key to creating Ultron.,"00:18:59,760","00:19:02,650"
315,James Rhodes,I thought Ultron was a fantasy.,"00:19:05,280","00:19:06,611"
316,Maria Hill,Yesterday it was.,"00:19:06,720","00:19:08,006"
317,James Rhodes,"If we can harness this power,","00:19:09,120","00:19:11,168"
318,Thor,apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?,"00:19:11,280","00:19:13,328"
319,Sam Wilson,"That's a man-sized ""if.""","00:19:14,120","00:19:16,088"
320,Steve Rogers,"Our job is ""if.""","00:19:16,240","00:19:18,561"
321,Sam Wilson,What if you were sipping margaritas,"00:19:18,680","00:19:21,286"
322,Sam Wilson,"on a sun-drenched beach,","00:19:18,680","00:19:21,286"
323,Sam Wilson,turning brown instead of green?,"00:19:21,400","00:19:23,926"

325,Sam Wilson,over your shoulder for Veronica.,"00:19:24,080","00:19:26,367"
326,Steve Rogers,Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.,"00:19:26,560","00:19:28,130"
327,Sam Wilson,"As a worst-case measure, right?","00:19:28,240","00:19:30,049"
328,Steve Rogers,How about a best case?,"00:19:30,160","00:19:31,764"
329,Sam Wilson,What if the world was safe?,"00:19:31,880","00:19:33,803"
330,James Rhodes,"What if, next time aliens roll up","00:19:33,960","00:19:36,725"
331,James Rhodes,"to the club, and they will,","00:19:33,960","00:19:36,725"
332,Party Guest,they couldn't get past the bouncer?,"00:19:37,280","00:19:38,770"
333,Thor,The only people threatening the planet,"00:19:38,920","00:19:42,322"
334,Thor,would be people.,"00:19:38,920","00:19:42,322"
335,Stan Lee,I want to apply this,"00:19:42,440","00:19:44,120"
336,Stan Lee,to the Ultron program.,"00:19:42,440","00:19:44,120"
337,Stan Lee,But Jarvis can't download,"00:19:44,760","00:19:47,604"
338,Thor,a data schematic this dense.,"00:19:44,760","00:19:47,604"
339,Thor,We can only do it,"00:19:47,760","00:19:49,680"
340,Bruce Banner,while we have the sceptre here.,"00:19:47,760","00:19:49,680"
341,Natasha Romanoff,That's three days. Give me three days.,"00:19:49,720","00:19:51,290"
342,Bruce Banner,"So you're going for artificial intelligence,","00:19:51,400","00:19:53,004"
343,Natasha Romanoff,and you don't want to tell the team?,"00:19:53,120","00:19:54,560"
344,Natasha Romanoff,Right. That's right. You know why?,"00:19:55,600","00:19:57,011"
345,Natasha Romanoff,Because we don't have time,"00:19:57,120","00:19:58,724"
346,Natasha Romanoff,for a city hall debate.,"00:19:57,120","00:19:58,724"
347,Natasha Romanoff,"I don't want to hear ""the man was","00:19:58,880","00:20:02,487"

349,Bruce Banner,I see a suit of armour around the world.,"00:20:02,600","00:20:04,728"
350,Natasha Romanoff,"Sounds like a cold world, Tony.","00:20:05,440","00:20:06,771"
351,Natasha Romanoff,I've seen colder.,"00:20:07,680","00:20:09,603"
352,Natasha Romanoff,"This one, this very vulnerable blue one,","00:20:10,640","00:20:14,281"
353,Bruce Banner,it needs Ultron.,"00:20:14,440","00:20:15,930"
354,Bruce Banner,Peace in our time.,"00:20:20,320","00:20:22,243"
355,Bruce Banner,Imagine that.,"00:20:23,800","00:20:25,290"
356,Natasha Romanoff,What did we miss?,"00:21:05,000","00:21:06,764"
357,Natasha Romanoff,I'll continue to run variations,"00:21:07,960","00:21:11,282"
358,Steve Rogers,on the interface.,"00:21:07,960","00:21:11,282"

360,Steve Rogers,prepare for your guests.,"00:21:11,400","00:21:14,165"

669,Ulysses Klaue,You built this program.,"00:34:26,640","00:34:28,563"
670,Ulysses Klaue,Why is it trying to kill us?,"00:34:30,320","00:34:31,731"

672,Wanda Maximoff,No.,"00:34:40,520","00:34:41,851"
673,Ulysses Klaue,"It's probably not, right?","00:34:42,440","00:34:44,363"
674,Ulysses Klaue,This is very terrible. Is it so...,"00:34:45,440","00:34:47,761"
675,Ulysses Klaue,Is it so... It is. It's so terrible.,"00:34:47,880","00:34:50,042"
676,Ulysses Klaue,This could have been avoided,"00:34:50,160","00:34:51,730"
677,Ulysses Klaue,if you hadn't played,"00:34:50,160","00:34:51,730"
678,Ulysses Klaue,with something you don't understand.,"00:34:51,840","00:34:53,365"
679,Ulysses Klaue,No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.,"00:34:53,520","00:34:56,171"

681,Ultron,that you don't get why we need this.,"00:34:56,320","00:34:58,482"
682,Ultron,"Tony, maybe this might not be the time.","00:34:58,640","00:35:00,802"
683,Ultron,Really? That's it?,"00:35:00,960","00:35:03,281"
684,Ultron,"You just roll over, show your belly","00:35:03,400","00:35:06,364"

689,Ultron,"Well, you did something right.","00:35:11,560","00:35:15,121"
690,Ultron,And you did it right here.,"00:35:11,560","00:35:15,121"
691,Ulysses Klaue,The Avengers were supposed,"00:35:15,200","00:35:17,009"
692,Ultron,to be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.,"00:35:15,200","00:35:17,009"
693,Ulysses Klaue,Anybody remember when,"00:35:17,240","00:35:20,210"

695,Ultron,"- No, it's never come up.","00:35:20,360","00:35:21,885"

697,Ultron,- Never heard that.,"00:35:22,040","00:35:23,963"
698,Ultron,- Recall that?,"00:35:22,040","00:35:23,963"
699,Ultron,A hostile alien army came charging,"00:35:24,080","00:35:27,766"

701,Ultron,We're standing 300 feet below it.,"00:35:28,360","00:35:30,567"
702,Ultron,We're the Avengers.,"00:35:32,200","00:35:33,725"

704,Ultron,"all the livelong day,","00:35:33,880","00:35:35,962"
705,Ultron,"but that up there, that's...","00:35:36,080","00:35:38,321"
706,Ultron,That's the endgame.,"00:35:39,040","00:35:40,963"
707,Tony Stark,How were you guys,"00:35:41,560","00:35:43,449"
708,Tony Stark,planning on beating that?,"00:35:41,560","00:35:43,449"
709,Ultron,Together.,"00:35:44,360","00:35:45,771"
710,Thor,We'll lose.,"00:35:49,120","00:35:50,485"
711,Ultron,"Then we'll do that together, too.","00:35:51,560","00:35:53,483"
712,Tony Stark,Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.,"00:35:56,400","00:35:58,687"
713,Pietro Maximoff,And I'd like to find him,"00:35:59,560","00:36:01,520"
714,Pietro Maximoff,before he's ready for us.,"00:35:59,560","00:36:01,520"
715,Pietro Maximoff,The world's a big place.,"00:36:02,760","00:36:06,443"
716,Pietro Maximoff,Let's start making it smaller.,"00:36:02,760","00:36:06,443"
717,Tony Stark,"Talk,","00:36:29,600","00:36:31,648"
718,Steve Rogers,and if you are wasting our time...,"00:36:29,600","00:36:31,648"
719,Wanda Maximoff,Did you know this church,"00:36:31,760","00:36:36,129"
720,Steve Rogers,is in the exact centre of the city?,"00:36:31,760","00:36:36,129"
721,Ultron,The elders decreed it so that,"00:36:36,280","00:36:40,886"
722,Ultron,everyone could be equally close to God.,"00:36:36,280","00:36:40,886"
723,Ultron,I like that.,"00:36:41,400","00:36:42,561"
724,Thor,The geometry of belief.,"00:36:43,080","00:36:45,003"
725,Ultron,You're wondering,"00:36:47,120","00:36:49,487"
726,Tony Stark,why you can't look inside my head.,"00:36:47,120","00:36:49,487"
727,Tony Stark,Sometimes it's hard.,"00:36:49,960","00:36:51,928"

729,Klaue's Mercenary,every man shows himself.,"00:36:52,080","00:36:54,367"
730,Ulysses Klaue,I'm sure they do.,"00:36:56,120","00:36:57,451"
731,Klaue's Mercenary,But you needed,"00:36:58,560","00:37:00,961"
732,Steve Rogers,something more than a man.,"00:36:58,560","00:37:00,961"
733,Ultron,That's why you let,"00:37:01,800","00:37:04,326"
734,Bruce Banner,Stark take the sceptre.,"00:37:01,800","00:37:04,326"
735,Bruce Banner,"I didn't expect,","00:37:04,720","00:37:05,721"
736,Steve Rogers,but I saw Stark's fear.,"00:37:08,240","00:37:10,163"

1126,Dr. Helen Cho,I need answers. I won't find them here.,"01:02:06,920","01:02:09,526"
1127,Ultron,We can go home.,"01:02:20,080","01:02:21,366"
1128,Ultron,See? You worried for nothing.,"01:02:32,880","01:02:34,723"
1129,Ultron,"Can't even feel the difference, can you?","01:02:34,840","01:02:36,968"
1130,Ultron,"If they're sleeping here,","01:02:39,320","01:02:40,526"

1133,Steve Rogers,"Yeah, that's not gonna sell.","01:02:44,600","01:02:46,728"
1134,Steve Rogers,What about Nat and Dr Banner?,"01:02:49,560","01:02:51,881"
1135,Dr. Helen Cho,How long has that been going on?,"01:02:52,320","01:02:54,243"
1136,Steve Rogers,Has what?,"01:02:54,760","01:02:56,808"
1137,Dr. Helen Cho,You are so cute.,"01:02:56,960","01:02:58,689"
1138,Dr. Helen Cho,Nat and Banner?,"01:02:58,920","01:03:00,365"
1139,Dr. Helen Cho,"I'll explain when you're older,","01:03:01,080","01:03:02,491"
1140,Dr. Helen Cho,- Hawkeye.,"01:03:02,680","01:03:05,365"
1141,Steve Rogers,"- Well, okay.","01:03:02,680","01:03:05,365"
1142,Steve Rogers,"It's bad, right?","01:03:07,320","01:03:08,731"
1143,Steve Rogers,Nat seems really shaken.,"01:03:09,080","01:03:10,241"
1144,Clint Barton,Ultron has these allies.,"01:03:11,720","01:03:13,210"
1145,Natasha Romanoff,"These kids. They're punks, really.","01:03:13,320","01:03:17,250"
1146,Natasha Romanoff,"But they carry a big, damn stick.","01:03:18,960","01:03:21,406"
1147,Clint Barton,And Nat took a serious hit.,"01:03:21,520","01:03:22,726"
1148,Clint Barton,Someone's gonna have to,"01:03:23,920","01:03:26,400"
1149,Clint Barton,teach them some manners.,"01:03:23,920","01:03:26,400"

1154,Steve Rogers,But I see those guys...,"01:03:36,080","01:03:37,411"
1155,Steve Rogers,Those gods...,"01:03:37,600","01:03:39,568"
1156,Steve Rogers,You don't think they need me.,"01:03:41,560","01:03:43,289"
1157,Ultron,"I think they do, which is a lot scarier.","01:03:43,960","01:03:47,601"
1158,Ultron,They're a mess.,"01:03:48,760","01:03:50,569"
1159,Steve Rogers,Yeah.,"01:03:51,560","01:03:52,561"
1160,Steve Rogers,I guess they're my mess.,"01:03:53,320","01:03:54,765"
1161,Clint Barton,You need to be sure,"01:03:56,320","01:03:57,924"

1163,Ultron,and that they have your back.,"01:04:01,160","01:04:02,844"
1164,Ultron,Things are changing for us.,"01:04:06,200","01:04:08,771"
1165,Steve Rogers,"In a few months' time,","01:04:08,880","01:04:11,281"
1166,Ultron,you and me are gonna be outnumbered.,"01:04:11,440","01:04:14,205"

1168,Clint Barton,Just be sure.,"01:04:18,800","01:04:20,609"
1169,Natasha Romanoff,"Yes, ma'am.","01:04:21,440","01:04:22,930"
1170,Clint Barton,I can feel the difference.,"01:04:32,160","01:04:34,003"
1171,Natasha Romanoff,"Scream, and your entire staff dies.","01:04:46,960","01:04:49,645"
1172,Clint Barton,"I could've killed you, Helen,","01:04:51,560","01:04:53,801"
1173,Natasha Romanoff,the night we met.,"01:04:51,560","01:04:53,801"
1174,Natasha Romanoff,I didn't.,"01:04:53,960","01:04:55,007"
1175,Steve Rogers,Do you expect a thank-you note?,"01:04:55,160","01:04:56,650"
1176,Natasha Romanoff,I expect you to know why.,"01:04:56,800","01:04:58,484"
1177,Clint Barton,The Cradle.,"01:04:59,920","01:05:01,206"
1178,Natasha Romanoff,"This is the next thing, Tony.","01:05:01,280","01:05:03,203"
1179,Clint Barton,This is the next me.,"01:05:03,360","01:05:06,330"
1180,Clint Barton,The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.,"01:05:06,720","01:05:09,291"
1181,Natasha Romanoff,It can't build a living body.,"01:05:09,400","01:05:11,050"
1182,Natasha Romanoff,It can. You can.,"01:05:11,160","01:05:12,241"
1183,Steve Rogers,You lack the materials.,"01:05:12,720","01:05:14,006"
1184,Clint Barton,"You're a brilliant woman, Helen.","01:05:16,440","01:05:17,805"
1185,Clint Barton,But we all have room to improve.,"01:05:21,080","01:05:24,163"
1186,Natasha Romanoff,I didn't realise you were waiting.,"01:05:45,960","01:05:48,361"
1187,Natasha Romanoff,"I would've joined you,","01:05:48,480","01:05:52,883"
1188,Clint Barton,but it didn't seem like the right time.,"01:05:48,480","01:05:52,883"
1189,Natasha Romanoff,They used up all the hot water.,"01:05:53,840","01:05:55,922"
1190,Clint Barton,I should've joined you.,"01:05:56,760","01:05:58,205"
1191,Natasha Romanoff,Missed our window.,"01:05:58,360","01:06:00,010"
1192,Ultron,Did we?,"01:06:00,800","01:06:02,040"
1193,Ultron,The world just saw the Hulk.,"01:06:05,600","01:06:06,726"
1194,Wanda Maximoff,"The real Hulk, for the first time.","01:06:09,400","01:06:11,323"
1195,Steve Rogers,- You know I have to leave.,"01:06:14,560","01:06:17,211"
1196,Steve Rogers,- You assume that I have to stay?,"01:06:14,560","01:06:17,211"
1197,Clint Barton,I had this dream.,"01:06:19,280","01:06:21,931"
1198,Clint Barton,"The kind that seems normal at the time,","01:06:22,280","01:06:24,248"
1199,Clint Barton,but when you wake...,"01:06:25,480","01:06:26,720"
1200,Steve Rogers,What did you dream?,"01:06:26,920","01:06:28,251"
1201,Steve Rogers,That I was an Avenger.,"01:06:29,280","01:06:31,089"
1202,Clint Barton,That I was anything more,"01:06:33,120","01:06:36,927"
1203,Clint Barton,than the assassin they made me.,"01:06:33,120","01:06:36,927"
1204,Steve Rogers,I think you're being hard on yourself.,"01:06:38,400","01:06:40,482"
1205,Steve Rogers,Here I was hoping that was your job.,"01:06:42,600","01:06:45,080"
1206,Pietro Maximoff,What are you doing?,"01:06:48,040","01:06:49,610"

1208,Steve Rogers,With you.,"01:06:54,360","01:06:55,964"
1209,Wanda Maximoff,"If running is the plan,","01:06:56,720","01:06:59,041"
1210,Steve Rogers,as far as you want.,"01:07:00,160","01:07:01,924"
1211,Wanda Maximoff,Are you out of your mind?,"01:07:03,800","01:07:05,564"
1212,Steve Rogers,I want you to understand that...,"01:07:10,920","01:07:12,331"
1213,Wanda Maximoff,"Natasha,","01:07:12,440","01:07:13,851"
1214,Steve Rogers,where can I go?,"01:07:14,960","01:07:16,405"
1215,Steve Rogers,Where in the world am I not a threat?,"01:07:17,480","01:07:19,801"
1216,Steve Rogers,- You're not a threat to me.,"01:07:19,920","01:07:22,241"
1217,Wanda Maximoff,- Are you sure?,"01:07:19,920","01:07:22,241"
1218,Wanda Maximoff,Even if I didn't just...,"01:07:23,160","01:07:24,969"
1219,Bruce Banner,There's no future with me.,"01:07:26,600","01:07:27,965"
1220,Tony Stark,I can't ever...,"01:07:29,640","01:07:30,641"
1221,Tony Stark,I can't have this.,"01:07:30,880","01:07:33,121"
1222,Clint Barton,Kids.,"01:07:33,840","01:07:34,966"
1223,Bruce Banner,Do the math. I physically can't.,"01:07:35,440","01:07:38,011"
1224,Bruce Banner,Neither can I.,"01:07:39,760","01:07:41,205"
1225,Tony Stark,In the Red Room where I was trained...,"01:07:45,880","01:07:49,407"
1226,Clint Barton,"Where I was raised,","01:07:49,880","01:07:52,360"
1227,Clint Barton,they have a graduation ceremony.,"01:07:53,320","01:07:55,971"
1228,Clint Barton,They sterilise you.,"01:07:57,600","01:07:59,409"
1229,Bruce Banner,It's efficient.,"01:08:02,640","01:08:04,051"
1230,Tony Stark,One less thing to worry about.,"01:08:06,960","01:08:08,325"
1231,Bruce Banner,The one thing,"01:08:10,440","01:08:13,808"
1232,Tony Stark,that might matter more than a mission.,"01:08:10,440","01:08:13,808"
1233,Bruce Banner,Makes everything easier.,"01:08:16,160","01:08:18,049"
1234,Tony Stark,Even killing.,"01:08:19,440","01:08:20,680"
1235,Tony Stark,You still think,"01:08:25,760","01:08:28,843"
1236,Tony Stark,you're the only monster on the team?,"01:08:25,760","01:08:28,843"
1237,JARVIS,"So, we disappear?","01:08:35,040","01:08:37,122"
1238,Tony Stark,Thor didn't say,"01:08:43,800","01:08:45,640"
1239,Tony Stark,where he was going for answers?,"01:08:43,800","01:08:45,640"
1240,Tony Stark,Sometimes my teammates,"01:08:46,480","01:08:49,006"
1241,Tony Stark,don't tell me things.,"01:08:46,480","01:08:49,006"
1242,Tony Stark,I was kind of hoping,"01:08:50,120","01:08:52,168"
1243,Tony Stark,Thor would be the exception.,"01:08:50,120","01:08:52,168"
1244,Tony Stark,"Yeah, give him time.","01:08:52,280","01:08:54,282"
1245,Bruce Banner,We don't know,"01:08:54,440","01:08:56,363"
1246,Tony Stark,what the Maximoff kid showed him.,"01:08:54,440","01:08:56,363"
1247,Tony Stark,"""Earth's mightiest heroes.""","01:08:58,560","01:09:00,164"
1248,Tony Stark,Pulled us apart like cotton candy.,"01:09:00,320","01:09:01,924"
1249,Tony Stark,Seems like you walked away all right.,"01:09:02,280","01:09:03,760"
1250,Bruce Banner,Is that a problem?,"01:09:06,200","01:09:07,201"
1251,Tony Stark,I don't trust a guy without a dark side.,"01:09:07,560","01:09:09,483"
1252,Tony Stark,Call me old-fashioned.,"01:09:10,680","01:09:11,727"
1253,Tony Stark,"Well, let's just say","01:09:11,840","01:09:14,411"
1254,JARVIS,you haven't seen it yet.,"01:09:11,840","01:09:14,411"
1255,Bruce Banner,You know Ultron is trying,"01:09:14,720","01:09:16,927"
1256,Bruce Banner,"to tear us apart, right?","01:09:14,720","01:09:16,927"
1257,Tony Stark,"Well, I guess you'd know.","01:09:17,160","01:09:19,401"
1258,Tony Stark,Whether you'd tell us,"01:09:19,520","01:09:20,806"
1259,Tony Stark,is a bit of a question.,"01:09:19,520","01:09:20,806"
1260,Tony Stark,Banner and I were doing research.,"01:09:20,960","01:09:22,086"
1261,Tony Stark,- That would affect the team.,"01:09:22,240","01:09:24,440"
1262,Tony Stark,- That would end the team!,"01:09:22,240","01:09:24,440"
1263,Tony Stark,Isn't that the mission?,"01:09:24,680","01:09:25,761"
1264,Tony Stark,"Isn't that the ""Why We Fight""?","01:09:25,960","01:09:27,200"
1265,Ultron,So we can end the fight.,"01:09:27,320","01:09:29,561"
1266,Ultron,So we get to go home!,"01:09:27,320","01:09:29,561"
1267,Ultron,Every time someone tries,"01:09:32,800","01:09:35,167"
1268,Ultron,"to win a war before it starts,","01:09:32,800","01:09:35,167"
1269,Ultron,innocent people die.,"01:09:35,280","01:09:36,850"
1270,Ultron,Every time.,"01:09:36,960","01:09:37,961"
1271,Ultron,I'm sorry. Mr Stark...,"01:09:40,440","01:09:42,841"
1272,Ultron,"Clint said you wouldn't mind,","01:09:43,720","01:09:44,880"
1273,Ultron,but our tractor doesn't seem,"01:09:44,920","01:09:47,446"
1274,Ultron,to want to start at all.,"01:09:44,920","01:09:47,446"
1275,Ultron,- I thought maybe you might...,"01:09:47,760","01:09:50,120"
1276,Ultron,"- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.","01:09:47,760","01:09:50,120"
1277,Ultron,Don't take from my pile.,"01:09:53,560","01:09:55,130"
1278,Ultron,"Hello, Deere.","01:10:05,360","01:10:06,521"
1279,Tony Stark,Tell me everything.,"01:10:09,400","01:10:10,811"
1280,Tony Stark,What ails you?,"01:10:12,040","01:10:13,405"
1281,Bruce Banner,Do me a favour.,"01:10:13,640","01:10:14,641"
1282,Steve Rogers,Try not to bring it to life.,"01:10:16,920","01:10:18,809"
1283,Tony Stark,"Why, Ms Barton, you little minx.","01:10:18,960","01:10:20,485"
1284,Steve Rogers,"I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?","01:10:20,840","01:10:23,366"
1285,Tony Stark,Was she ever not working for you?,"01:10:23,480","01:10:24,800"
1286,Steve Rogers,Artificial intelligence.,"01:10:24,880","01:10:26,370"
1287,Bruce Banner,You never even hesitated.,"01:10:27,400","01:10:29,050"
1288,Bruce Banner,"Look, it's been a really long day,","01:10:29,360","01:10:30,720"
1289,Wanda Maximoff,"like Eugene O'Neill long,","01:10:30,800","01:10:32,404"
1290,Bruce Banner,so how's about,"01:10:32,520","01:10:34,680"
1291,Bruce Banner,we skip to the part where you're useful.,"01:10:32,520","01:10:34,680"
1292,Tony Stark,Look me in the eye and tell me,"01:10:34,720","01:10:37,320"
1293,Wanda Maximoff,you're going to shut him down.,"01:10:34,720","01:10:37,320"
1294,Pietro Maximoff,You're not the director of me.,"01:10:37,640","01:10:39,051"
1295,Pietro Maximoff,I'm not the director of anybody.,"01:10:39,160","01:10:41,003"
1296,Pietro Maximoff,I'm just an old man,"01:10:41,320","01:10:42,924"
1297,Pietro Maximoff,who cares very much about you.,"01:10:43,600","01:10:45,170"
1298,Clint Barton,And I'm the man,"01:10:48,040","01:10:49,849"
1299,Clint Barton,who killed the Avengers.,"01:10:48,040","01:10:49,849"
1300,Tony Stark,I saw it.,"01:10:51,680","01:10:52,806"
1301,Bruce Banner,I didn't tell the team. How could I?,"01:10:53,000","01:10:54,570"
1302,Bruce Banner,"I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.","01:10:55,840","01:10:57,683"
1303,Vision,"The whole world, too.","01:10:58,040","01:10:59,565"
1304,Vision,Because of me.,"01:11:00,000","01:11:01,001"
1305,Steve Rogers,I wasn't ready.,"01:11:02,240","01:11:03,685"
