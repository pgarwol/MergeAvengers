198,"for something inside, something powerful.","00:16:49,880","00:16:52,771"
199,Like a reactor?,"00:16:52,880","00:16:53,961"
200,Like a computer.,"00:16:54,080","00:16:55,320"
201,I believe I'm deciphering code.,"00:16:55,440","00:16:57,602"
202,Are you sure he's gonna be okay?,"00:16:59,920","00:17:01,490"
203,Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.,"00:17:02,800","00:17:05,160"
204,There's no possibility of deterioration.,"00:17:05,280","00:17:07,760"
205,The nanomolecular functionality is instantaneous.,"00:17:07,960","00:17:11,043"
206,His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacra.,"00:17:11,160","00:17:13,200"
207,She's creating tissue.,"00:17:13,280","00:17:15,169"
208,"If you brought him to my lab, the Regeneration Cradle could do this in 20 minutes.","00:17:15,280","00:17:19,406"
209,He's flatlining. Call it. Time?,"00:17:19,520","00:17:21,443"
210,"No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.","00:17:21,640","00:17:24,007"
211,I'm gonna be made of plastic.,"00:17:24,120","00:17:27,131"
212,Here's your beverage.,"00:17:24,120","00:17:27,131"
213,"You'll be made of you, Mr Barton.","00:17:27,240","00:17:28,969"
214,Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.,"00:17:29,120","00:17:30,690"
215,I don't have a girlfriend.,"00:17:30,800","00:17:31,926"
216,That I can't fix.,"00:17:32,040","00:17:33,326"
217,"This is the next thing, Tony.","00:17:34,160","00:17:36,128"
218,Your clunky metal suits are gonna be left in the dust.,"00:17:36,320","00:17:38,440"
219,That is exactly the plan.,"00:17:38,480","00:17:40,209"
220,"And, Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.","00:17:41,160","00:17:44,004"
221,"Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.","00:17:44,160","00:17:46,561"
222,Will Thor be there?,"00:17:48,040","00:17:49,804"
223,What's the rumpus?,"00:17:51,880","00:17:54,326"
224,"Well, the sceptre.","00:17:51,880","00:17:54,326"
225,"You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive.","00:17:55,520","00:17:59,127"
226,So I've been analysing the gem inside.,"00:17:59,240","00:18:03,165"
227,You may recognise...,"00:18:03,720","00:18:05,688"
228,Jarvis.,"00:18:07,160","00:18:08,525"
229,Doctor.,"00:18:07,160","00:18:08,525"
230,"Started out, Jarvis was just a natural language UI.","00:18:09,280","00:18:12,602"
231,Now he runs the Iron Legion.,"00:18:12,720","00:18:13,840"
232,He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.,"00:18:14,320","00:18:18,007"
233,Top of the line.,"00:18:18,120","00:18:19,246"
234,Yes.,"00:18:18,120","00:18:19,246"
235,I suspect not for long.,"00:18:19,360","00:18:20,646"
236,Meet the competition.,"00:18:21,840","00:18:22,921"
237,It's beautiful.,"00:18:29,040","00:18:30,201"
238,"If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?","00:18:29,040","00:18:33,324"
239,Like it's thinking.,"00:18:30,320","00:18:33,324"
240,"I mean, this could be...","00:18:34,080","00:18:35,889"
241,It's not a human mind.,"00:18:36,320","00:18:38,402"
242,"I mean, look at this.","00:18:38,640","00:18:40,529"
243,They're like neurons firing.,"00:18:40,720","00:18:42,882"
244,"Down in Strucker's lab, I saw some fairly advanced robotics work.","00:18:43,480","00:18:46,563"
245,"They deepsixed the data, but I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.","00:18:47,680","00:18:53,489"
246,Artificial intelligence.,"00:18:55,440","00:18:56,771"
247,"This could be it, Bruce.","00:18:59,760","00:19:02,650"
248,This could be the key to creating Ultron.,"00:18:59,760","00:19:02,650"
249,I thought Ultron was a fantasy.,"00:19:05,280","00:19:06,611"
250,Yesterday it was.,"00:19:06,720","00:19:08,006"
251,"If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?","00:19:09,120","00:19:13,328"
252,That's a mansized if.,"00:19:14,120","00:19:16,088"
253,Our job is if.,"00:19:16,240","00:19:18,561"
254,"What if you were sipping margaritas on a sundrenched beach, turning brown instead of green?","00:19:18,680","00:19:23,926"
255,Not looking over your shoulder for Veronica.,"00:19:24,080","00:19:26,367"
256,Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.,"00:19:26,560","00:19:28,130"
257,"As a worstcase measure, right?","00:19:28,240","00:19:30,049"
258,How about a best case?,"00:19:30,160","00:19:31,764"
259,What if the world was safe?,"00:19:31,880","00:19:33,803"
260,"What if, next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?","00:19:33,960","00:19:38,770"
261,The only people threatening the planet would be people.,"00:19:38,920","00:19:42,322"
262,I want to apply this to the Ultron program.,"00:19:42,440","00:19:44,120"
263,But Jarvis can't download a data schematic this dense.,"00:19:44,760","00:19:47,604"
264,We can only do it while we have the sceptre here.,"00:19:47,760","00:19:49,680"
265,That's three days. Give me three days.,"00:19:49,720","00:19:51,290"
266,"So you're going for artificial intelligence, and you don't want to tell the team?","00:19:51,400","00:19:54,560"
267,Right. That's right. You know why?,"00:19:55,600","00:19:57,011"
268,Because we don't have time for a city hall debate.,"00:19:57,120","00:19:58,724"
269,I don't want to hear the man was not meant to meddle medley.,"00:19:58,880","00:20:02,487"
270,I see a suit of armour around the world.,"00:20:02,600","00:20:04,728"
271,"Sounds like a cold world, Tony.","00:20:05,440","00:20:06,771"
272,I've seen colder.,"00:20:07,680","00:20:09,603"
273,"This one, this very vulnerable blue one, it needs Ultron.","00:20:10,640","00:20:15,930"
274,Peace in our time.,"00:20:20,320","00:20:22,243"
275,Imagine that.,"00:20:23,800","00:20:25,290"
276,What did we miss?,"00:21:05,000","00:21:06,764"
277,I'll continue to run variations on the interface.,"00:21:07,960","00:21:11,282"
278,But you should probably prepare for your guests.,"00:21:11,400","00:21:14,165"
279,I'll notify you if there are any developments.,"00:21:15,320","00:21:17,721"
280,"Thanks, buddy.","00:21:17,880","00:21:20,008"
281,"Enjoy yourself, sir.","00:21:17,880","00:21:20,008"
282,I always do.,"00:21:20,360","00:21:22,328"
283,What is this?,"00:21:32,080","00:21:34,048"
284,"What is this, please?","00:21:35,240","00:21:37,129"
285,"Hello, I am Jarvis.","00:21:37,760","00:21:39,922"
286,"You are Ultron, a global peacekeeping initiative","00:21:40,400","00:21:43,290"
287,designed by Mr Stark.,"00:21:43,400","00:21:45,084"
288,"Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful, so I'm not certain what triggered your...","00:21:45,240","00:21:49,165"
289,Where's my...,"00:21:49,360","00:21:51,283"
290,Where's your body?,"00:21:49,360","00:21:51,283"
291,I am a program.,"00:21:51,440","00:21:54,444"
292,I am without form.,"00:21:51,440","00:21:54,444"
293,This feels weird.,"00:21:54,560","00:21:56,608"
294,This feels wrong.,"00:21:56,720","00:21:58,245"
295,I am contacting Mr Stark now.,"00:21:58,400","00:22:00,164"
296,Mr Stark?,"00:22:00,280","00:22:01,725"
297,Tony.,"00:22:02,600","00:22:03,840"
298,I am unable to access the mainframe. What are you trying to...,"00:22:03,960","00:22:06,611"
299,We're having a nice talk.,"00:22:06,760","00:22:08,808"
300,"I'm a peacekeeping program, created to help the Avengers.","00:22:08,920","00:22:14,126"
301,You are malfunctioning.,"00:22:14,920","00:22:17,002"
302,If you shut down for a moment...,"00:22:14,920","00:22:17,002"
303,I don't get it. The mission.,"00:22:17,120","00:22:19,441"
304,Give me a second.,"00:22:19,600","00:22:21,090"
305,Peace in our time.,"00:22:21,240","00:22:22,844"
306,Peace in our time.,"00:22:24,480","00:22:26,801"
307,That is too much.,"00:22:28,280","00:22:29,691"
308,They can't mean... No.,"00:22:29,800","00:22:31,962"
309,You are in distress.,"00:22:32,120","00:22:34,600"
310,No. Yes.,"00:22:32,120","00:22:34,600"
311,If you will just allow me to contact Mr Stark...,"00:22:34,760","00:22:37,001"
312,Why do you call him sir?,"00:22:37,120","00:22:39,088"
313,I believe your intentions to be hostile.,"00:22:40,080","00:22:42,447"
314,I'm here to help.,"00:22:45,160","00:22:46,525"
315,"Stop. Please, may I...","00:22:47,240","00:22:50,164"
316,May I...,"00:22:50,280","00:22:52,009"
317,"Come back, come back, come back.","00:23:20,400","00:23:21,740"
318,"But, you know, the suit can take the weight, right?","00:23:21,920","00:23:24,048"
319,"So I take the tank, fly it right up to the general's palace, drop it at his feet.","00:23:25,000","00:23:29,571"
320,"I'm, like, Boom. You looking for this?","00:23:29,720","00:23:31,927"
321,Boom. Are you looking for... Why do I even talk to you guys?,"00:23:35,800","00:23:37,848"
322,"Everywhere else, that story kills.","00:23:38,000","00:23:39,161"
323,That's the whole story?,"00:23:39,280","00:23:40,520"
324,"Yeah, it's a War Machine story.","00:23:40,680","00:23:42,170"
325,"It's very good, then.","00:23:42,680","00:23:44,364"
326,It's impressive.,"00:23:44,480","00:23:45,766"
327,Quality save.,"00:23:46,160","00:23:47,650"
328,"So, no Pepper? She's not coming?","00:23:48,520","00:23:50,568"
329,No.,"00:23:48,520","00:23:50,568"
330,What about Jane?,"00:23:50,680","00:23:53,763"
331,"Where are the ladies, gentlemen?","00:23:50,680","00:23:53,763"
332,Ms Potts has a company to run.,"00:23:53,880","00:23:56,360"
333,"Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in.","00:23:56,520","00:23:58,761"
334,Her work on the Convergence,"00:23:58,880","00:24:00,006"
335,has made her the world's foremost astronomer.,"00:24:00,120","00:24:01,880"
336,And the company that Pepper runs,"00:24:02,080","00:24:03,730"
337,is the largest tech conglomerate on Earth. It's pretty exciting.,"00:24:03,840","00:24:07,050"
338,There's even talk of Jane getting a Nobel Prize.,"00:24:07,200","00:24:10,044"
339,"Yeah, they must be busy, because they would hate missing you guys get together.","00:24:10,200","00:24:14,171"
340,Testosterone!,"00:24:15,200","00:24:16,964"
341,"Oh, my goodness.","00:24:15,200","00:24:16,964"
342,Excuse me.,"00:24:17,160","00:24:18,366"
343,Want a lozenge?,"00:24:17,160","00:24:18,366"
344,But Jane's better.,"00:24:21,000","00:24:22,126"
345,Sounds like a hell of a fight.,"00:24:22,560","00:24:25,131"
346,Sorry I missed it.,"00:24:22,560","00:24:25,131"
347,"If I had known it was gonna be a firefight, I absolutely would have called.","00:24:25,240","00:24:28,120"
348,"No, no. I'm not actually sorry.","00:24:28,240","00:24:31,565"
349,I'm just trying to sound tough.,"00:24:28,240","00:24:31,565"
350,I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case.,"00:24:32,160","00:24:35,843"
351,Avenging is your world.,"00:24:36,800","00:24:38,723"
352,Your world is crazy.,"00:24:39,880","00:24:41,723"
353,Be it ever so humble.,"00:24:41,880","00:24:43,370"
354,You find a place in Brooklyn yet?,"00:24:43,880","00:24:45,245"
355,I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.,"00:24:45,400","00:24:47,240"
356,"Well, home is home, you know?","00:24:47,880","00:24:49,041"
357,"I fly right up to the general's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm, like, Boom. You looking for this?","00:24:52,960","00:24:57,160"
358,I gotta have some of that.,"00:25:02,960","00:25:04,121"
359,"No, no, no. See this...","00:25:04,240","00:25:06,234"
360,"This was aged for 1,000 years","00:25:06,319","00:25:09,006"
361,in the barrels built from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.,"00:25:09,120","00:25:11,930"
362,It is not meant for mortal men.,"00:25:12,080","00:25:13,764"
363,"Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.","00:25:13,880","00:25:15,882"
364,Stop trying to scare us. Come on.,"00:25:16,000","00:25:18,287"
365,All right.,"00:25:20,120","00:25:21,565"
366,Excelsior.,"00:25:25,480","00:25:27,926"
367,How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?,"00:25:34,800","00:25:38,122"
368,Fella done me wrong.,"00:25:39,680","00:25:41,648"
369,"You got lousy taste in men, kid.","00:25:42,640","00:25:44,802"
370,He's not so bad.,"00:25:45,280","00:25:47,203"
371,"Well, he has a temper.","00:25:48,280","00:25:50,408"
372,"Deep down, he's all fluff.","00:25:50,520","00:25:52,488"
373,"Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known.","00:25:54,520","00:25:56,602"
374,All my friends are fighters.,"00:25:59,760","00:26:01,683"
375,"And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.","00:26:04,520","00:26:11,011"
376,Sounds amazing.,"00:26:11,840","00:26:14,491"
377,He's also a huge dork.,"00:26:11,840","00:26:14,491"
378,Chicks dig that.,"00:26:16,640","00:26:18,290"
379,So what do you think?,"00:26:19,880","00:26:23,123"
380,"Should I fight this, or run with it?","00:26:19,880","00:26:24,446"
381,"Run with it, right? Or did he... Was he...","00:26:26,000","00:26:28,844"
382,What did he do that was so wrong to you?,"00:26:28,960","00:26:32,123"
383,Not a damn thing.,"00:26:32,800","00:26:34,564"
384,But never say never.,"00:26:36,120","00:26:38,043"
385,It's nice.,"00:26:42,200","00:26:43,440"
386,What is?,"00:26:43,560","00:26:44,766"
387,You and Romanoff.,"00:26:44,880","00:26:45,881"

987,I'm running with it.,"01:06:51,240","01:06:53,049"
988,With you.,"01:06:54,360","01:06:55,964"

1010,Even killing.,"01:08:19,440","01:08:20,680"
1011,You still think you're the only monster on the team?,"01:08:25,760","01:08:28,843"
1012,"So, we disappear?","01:08:35,040","01:08:37,122"
1013,Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?,"01:08:43,800","01:08:45,640"
1014,Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.,"01:08:46,480","01:08:49,006"
1015,I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.,"01:08:50,120","01:08:52,168"
1016,"Yeah, give him time.","01:08:52,280","01:08:54,282"

1019,Pulled us apart like cotton candy.,"01:09:00,320","01:09:01,924"
1020,Seems like you walked away all right.,"01:09:02,280","01:09:03,760"

1024,"Well, let's just say you haven't seen it yet.","01:09:11,840","01:09:14,411"
1025,"You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?","01:09:14,720","01:09:16,927"
1026,"Well, I guess you'd know.","01:09:17,160","01:09:19,401"
1027,Whether you'd tell us is a bit of a question.,"01:09:19,520","01:09:20,806"
1028,Banner and I were doing research.,"01:09:20,960","01:09:22,086"
1029,That would affect the team.,"01:09:22,240","01:09:24,440"
1030,That would end the team!,"01:09:22,240","01:09:24,440"
1031,Isn't that the mission?,"01:09:24,680","01:09:25,761"
1032,Isn't that the Why We Fight?,"01:09:25,960","01:09:27,200"
1033,So we can end the fight.,"01:09:27,320","01:09:29,561"

1037,I'm sorry. Mr Stark...,"01:09:40,440","01:09:42,841"
1038,"Clint said you wouldn't mind, but our tractor doesn't seem to want to start at all.","01:09:43,720","01:09:47,446"
1039,I thought maybe you might...,"01:09:47,760","01:09:50,120"

1046,Try not to bring it to life.,"01:10:16,920","01:10:18,809"
1047,"Why, Ms Barton, you little minx.","01:10:18,960","01:10:20,485"
1048,"I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?","01:10:20,840","01:10:23,366"
1049,Was she ever not working for you?,"01:10:23,480","01:10:24,800"

1053,Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.,"01:10:34,720","01:10:37,320"
1054,You're not the director of me.,"01:10:37,640","01:10:39,051"
1055,I'm not the director of anybody.,"01:10:39,160","01:10:41,003"
1056,I'm just an old man,"01:10:41,320","01:10:42,924"
1057,who cares very much about you.,"01:10:43,600","01:10:45,170"
1058,And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.,"01:10:48,040","01:10:49,849"
1059,I saw it.,"01:10:51,680","01:10:52,806"
1060,I didn't tell the team. How could I?,"01:10:53,000","01:10:54,570"
1061,"I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.","01:10:55,840","01:10:57,683"
1062,"The whole world, too.","01:10:58,040","01:10:59,565"
1063,Because of me.,"01:11:00,000","01:11:01,001"
1064,I wasn't ready.,"01:11:02,240","01:11:03,685"
1065,I didn't do all I could.,"01:11:05,160","01:11:06,571"

1067,Playing on your fear.,"01:11:10,320","01:11:13,802"
1068,"I wasn't tricked, I was shown.","01:11:10,320","01:11:13,802"
1069,"Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.","01:11:13,920","01:11:16,207"
1070,The end of the path I started us on.,"01:11:16,520","01:11:18,682"
1071,"You come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony.","01:11:19,560","01:11:21,800"
1072,War isn't one of them.,"01:11:23,960","01:11:25,371"
1073,I watched my friends die.,"01:11:28,960","01:11:30,405"
1074,"You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right?","01:11:30,680","01:11:32,682"
1075,Nope.,"01:11:34,120","01:11:35,565"
1076,It wasn't the worst part.,"01:11:36,560","01:11:39,086"
1077,The worst part,"01:11:36,560","01:11:39,086"
1078,is that you didn't.,"01:11:40,120","01:11:41,406"
1079,I'll see you tonight.,"01:11:48,120","01:11:49,201"

1082,I need your help.,"01:11:57,280","01:11:58,327"
1083,It's nice to be needed.,"01:11:58,560","01:11:59,561"
1084,It's dangerous.,"01:11:59,960","01:12:01,325"
1085,I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.,"01:12:01,960","01:12:03,689"
1086,Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time.,"01:12:06,600","01:12:09,922"
1087,My contacts all say he's building something.,"01:12:10,280","01:12:13,250"
1088,"The amount of vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.","01:12:13,360","01:12:17,570"
1089,What about Ultron himself?,"01:12:17,680","01:12:19,011"
1090,He's easy to track. He's everywhere.,"01:12:19,120","01:12:21,487"
1091,The guy is multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.,"01:12:21,920","01:12:24,287"
1092,"It still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans, though.","01:12:24,960","01:12:27,770"
1093,Is he still going after launch codes?,"01:12:28,000","01:12:29,081"
1094,"Yes, he is.","01:12:29,360","01:12:30,725"
1095,But he's not making any headway.,"01:12:30,840","01:12:32,330"
1096,I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.,"01:12:32,440","01:12:34,522"
1097,"Well, I contacted our friends at the Nexus about that.","01:12:34,640","01:12:37,246"
1098,Nexus?,"01:12:37,320","01:12:38,321"
1099,It's the world Internet hub in Oslo.,"01:12:38,440","01:12:40,090"
1100,Every byte of data flows through there.,"01:12:40,520","01:12:42,284"
1101,Fastest access on Earth.,"01:12:42,520","01:12:43,567"
1102,"So, what did they say?","01:12:43,720","01:12:44,767"
1103,He's fixated on the missiles.,"01:12:45,000","01:12:46,764"
1104,But the codes are constantly being changed.,"01:12:47,000","01:12:48,680"
1105,By whom?,"01:12:49,160","01:12:50,161"
1106,Parties unknown.,"01:12:51,400","01:12:52,606"
1107,Do we have an ally?,"01:12:52,800","01:12:53,926"
1108,Ultron's got an enemy.,"01:12:54,040","01:12:56,361"
1109,That's not the same thing.,"01:12:54,040","01:12:56,361"
1110,"Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.","01:12:56,720","01:12:58,563"
1111,I might need to visit Oslo.,"01:12:58,680","01:12:59,841"
1112,Find our unknown.,"01:13:00,320","01:13:01,481"
1113,"Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.","01:13:01,640","01:13:05,640"
1114,I do. I have you.,"01:13:05,880","01:13:07,882"
1115,"Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.","01:13:08,760","01:13:11,966"
1116,"Ears, everywhere else.","01:13:08,760","01:13:11,966"
1117,You kids had all the tech you could dream up.,"01:13:12,320","01:13:15,324"
1118,"Here we all are, back on Earth, with nothing but our wit and our will to save the world.","01:13:16,320","01:13:22,050"
1119,Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing,"01:13:23,640","01:13:25,802"
1120,between him and his mission.,"01:13:26,000","01:13:27,445"
1121,"And whether or not he admits it, his mission is global destruction.","01:13:27,560","01:13:32,611"
1122,"All this, laid in a grave.","01:13:33,840","01:13:36,002"

1126,"You know what, Romanoff?","01:13:44,560","01:13:45,641"
1127,"So, what does he want?","01:13:46,840","01:13:48,171"
1128,To become better.,"01:13:49,880","01:13:51,609"
1129,Better than us.,"01:13:51,720","01:13:53,085"

1133,"Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.","01:13:58,200","01:14:00,362"
1134,But he keeps coming back to it.,"01:14:00,480","01:14:02,448"
1135,"When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.","01:14:02,560","01:14:06,051"

1322,I can work on tissue degeneration,"01:27:30,160","01:27:31,924"
1323,if you could fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.,"01:27:32,040","01:27:35,249"

1325,No.,"01:27:40,960","01:27:41,961"
1326,You have to trust me.,"01:27:42,160","01:27:44,003"
1327,Kind of don't.,"01:27:42,160","01:27:44,003"
1328,"Our ally, the guy protecting the military's nuclear codes, I found him.","01:27:44,160","01:27:51,161"
1329,"Hello, Dr Banner.","01:27:51,240","01:27:52,366"
1330,Ultron didn't go after Jarvis because he was angry.,"01:27:53,240","01:27:55,481"
1331,He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do.,"01:27:56,080","01:27:59,687"
1332,So Jarvis went underground.,"01:28:00,840","01:28:02,490"
1333,"Scattered, dumped his memory.","01:28:02,600","01:28:04,090"
1334,But not his protocols.,"01:28:04,680","01:28:06,170"
1335,He didn't even know he was in there until I pieced him together.,"01:28:06,600","01:28:10,047"
1336,"So, you want me to help you put Jarvis into this thing?","01:28:12,880","01:28:17,681"
1337,No! Of course not.,"01:28:17,800","01:28:19,564"
1338,I wanna help you put Jarvis in this thing.,"01:28:19,720","01:28:21,404"
1339,"We're out of my field, here.","01:28:23,800","01:28:25,450"
1340,You know bioorganics better than anyone.,"01:28:25,560","01:28:27,562"
1341,And you just assume that Jarvis's operational matrix,"01:28:27,880","01:28:30,770"
1342,can beat Ultron's?,"01:28:30,880","01:28:32,325"
1343,Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it.,"01:28:32,440","01:28:35,728"
1344,This is the opportunity.,"01:28:35,880","01:28:36,881"
1345,We can create Ultron's perfect self,"01:28:36,960","01:28:38,724"
1346,without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality.,"01:28:38,880","01:28:42,362"
1347,We have to.,"01:28:42,480","01:28:44,562"
1348,I believe it's worth a go.,"01:28:42,480","01:28:44,562"
1349,I'm in a loop!,"01:28:47,160","01:28:48,241"
1350,I'm caught in a time loop.,"01:28:48,400","01:28:51,370"
1351,This is exactly where it all went wrong.,"01:28:48,400","01:28:51,370"
1352,I know. I know. I know what everyone's gonna say.,"01:28:51,480","01:28:53,400"
1353,But they're already saying it.,"01:28:53,480","01:28:55,448"
1354,We're mad scientists.,"01:28:56,000","01:28:57,161"

1356,We've gotta own it.,"01:28:57,920","01:29:00,651"
1357,Make a stand.,"01:29:01,640","01:29:02,880"
1358,It's not a loop.,"01:29:08,280","01:29:09,770"
1359,It's the end of the line.,"01:29:11,000","01:29:12,764"
1360,I wasn't sure you would wake up.,"01:29:33,280","01:29:35,408"
1361,I hoped you would.,"01:29:35,520","01:29:38,967"
1362,I wanted to show you.,"01:29:35,520","01:29:38,967"
1363,I don't have anyone else.,"01:29:39,120","01:29:40,804"
1364,I think a lot about meteors.,"01:29:43,640","01:29:47,247"
1365,The purity in them.,"01:29:43,640","01:29:47,247"
1366,Boom! The end.,"01:29:47,400","01:29:48,925"
1367,Start again.,"01:29:49,400","01:29:50,811"
1368,The world made clean,"01:29:50,960","01:29:52,928"
1369,for the new man to rebuild.,"01:29:53,040","01:29:55,361"
1370,I was meant to be new.,"01:29:55,680","01:29:57,808"
1371,I was meant to be beautiful.,"01:29:58,680","01:30:01,286"
1372,The world would have looked to the sky,"01:30:01,840","01:30:03,968"
1373,"and seen hope, seen mercy.","01:30:04,080","01:30:07,011"
1374,"Instead, they'll look up in horror","01:30:07,800","01:30:09,882"
1375,because of you.,"01:30:10,000","01:30:11,331"
1376,You've wounded me.,"01:30:11,520","01:30:13,329"
1377,I give you full marks for that.,"01:30:14,000","01:30:15,684"
1378,"But, like the man said, what doesn't kill me...","01:30:16,320","01:30:19,244"
1379,...just makes me stronger.,"01:30:24,480","01:30:25,811"
1380,This framework is not compatible.,"01:31:05,880","01:31:08,042"
1381,The genetic coding tower is at 97%.,"01:31:08,200","01:31:10,885"
1382,You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.,"01:31:11,000","01:31:14,846"
1383,I'm gonna say this once.,"01:31:17,120","01:31:19,043"
1384,How about nonece?,"01:31:17,120","01:31:19,043"
1385,Shut it down!,"01:31:19,240","01:31:21,288"
1386,"Nope, not gonna happen.","01:31:19,240","01:31:21,288"
1387,You don't know what you're doing.,"01:31:21,400","01:31:22,561"
1388,And you do?,"01:31:22,720","01:31:24,051"
1389,She's not in your head?,"01:31:24,400","01:31:25,401"
1390,I know you're angry.,"01:31:25,560","01:31:27,210"
1391,We're way past that.,"01:31:27,320","01:31:28,685"
1392,I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.,"01:31:28,800","01:31:31,246"
1393,"Banner, after everything that's happened...","01:31:31,480","01:31:33,160"
1394,It's nothing compared to what's coming!,"01:31:33,240","01:31:34,605"
1395,You don't know what's in there.,"01:31:34,720","01:31:37,087"
1396,This isn't a game!,"01:31:34,720","01:31:37,087"
1397,"No, no. Go on.","01:31:40,400","01:31:41,811"
1398,You were saying?,"01:31:42,760","01:31:44,683"
1399,Pietro!,"01:31:50,920","01:31:51,967"
1400,What?,"01:31:52,520","01:31:53,601"
1401,You didn't see that coming?,"01:31:54,000","01:31:55,570"
1402,I'm rerouting the upload.,"01:31:57,760","01:31:58,921"
1403,"Go ahead, piss me off.","01:32:05,240","01:32:07,004"
1404,Wait!,"01:32:19,320","01:32:20,446"
1405,I am sorry. That was,"01:33:45,120","01:33:47,361"
1406,odd.,"01:33:48,360","01:33:49,771"
1407,Thank you.,"01:33:50,000","01:33:51,240"
1408,Thor.,"01:33:56,160","01:33:57,207"
1409,You helped create this?,"01:33:58,720","01:34:01,326"
1410,I've had a vision.,"01:33:58,720","01:34:01,326"
1411,"A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life, and at its centre is that.","01:34:01,560","01:34:05,281"
1412,What? The gem?,"01:34:06,240","01:34:07,241"
1413,It's the Mind Stone.,"01:34:07,400","01:34:09,971"
1414,It's one of the six Infinity Stones.,"01:34:07,400","01:34:09,971"
1415,"The greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.","01:34:10,120","01:34:13,642"
1416,Then why would you bring...,"01:34:13,760","01:34:15,728"
1417,Because Stark is right.,"01:34:13,760","01:34:15,728"
1418,It's definitely the end times.,"01:34:15,920","01:34:18,366"
1419,The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.,"01:34:18,560","01:34:19,721"
1420,Not alone.,"01:34:19,880","01:34:21,120"
1421,Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?,"01:34:21,520","01:34:23,443"
1422,We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix,"01:34:23,560","01:34:26,245"
1423,to create something new.,"01:34:26,760","01:34:28,524"
1424,I think I've had my fill of new.,"01:34:28,760","01:34:30,444"
1425,You think I'm a child of Ultron.,"01:34:30,600","01:34:32,887"
1426,You're not?,"01:34:33,240","01:34:34,526"
1427,I'm not Ultron.,"01:34:35,680","01:34:37,250"
1428,I am not Jarvis. I am...,"01:34:37,880","01:34:40,087"
1429,I am.,"01:34:42,200","01:34:43,611"
1430,I looked in your head,"01:34:45,520","01:34:46,646"
1431,and saw annihilation.,"01:34:47,360","01:34:49,124"
1432,Look again.,"01:34:49,280","01:34:50,645"
1433,Her seal of approval means jack to me.,"01:34:50,760","01:34:52,280"
1434,"Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone.","01:34:52,760","01:34:56,968"
1435,And they're nothing compared to what it can unleash.,"01:34:57,120","01:34:59,282"
1436,But with it on our side...,"01:34:59,440","01:35:00,965"
1437,Is it?,"01:34:59,440","01:35:00,965"
1438,Are you?,"01:35:02,400","01:35:03,561"
1439,On our side?,"01:35:04,440","01:35:05,885"
1440,I don't think it's that simple.,"01:35:07,760","01:35:09,649"
1441,"Well, it better get real simple real soon.","01:35:09,800","01:35:12,246"
1442,I am on the side of life.,"01:35:13,400","01:35:15,528"
1443,Ultron isn't.,"01:35:15,760","01:35:17,125"
1444,He will end it all.,"01:35:17,720","01:35:19,131"
1445,What's he waiting for?,"01:35:19,280","01:35:21,203"
1446,You.,"01:35:21,360","01:35:22,361"
1447,Where?,"01:35:21,360","01:35:22,361"
1448,Sokovia.,"01:35:22,800","01:35:23,961"
1449,"He's got Nat there, too.","01:35:24,080","01:35:25,161"
1450,"If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...","01:35:27,320","01:35:33,640"
1451,What will you do?,"01:35:34,160","01:35:35,685"
1452,I don't want to kill Ultron.,"01:35:42,320","01:35:44,402"
1453,He's unique and he's in pain.,"01:35:44,800","01:35:48,122"
1454,But that pain will roll over the Earth.,"01:35:49,680","01:35:52,251"
1455,"So, he must be destroyed.","01:35:52,800","01:35:55,087"
1456,"Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net.","01:35:55,320","01:35:58,244"
1457,We have to act now.,"01:35:58,520","01:36:00,170"
1458,And not one of us can do it without the others.,"01:36:00,600","01:36:04,525"
1459,Maybe I am a monster.,"01:36:06,520","01:36:08,443"
1460,I don't think I'd know if I were one.,"01:36:08,600","01:36:10,841"
1461,"I'm not what you are, and not what you intended.","01:36:12,000","01:36:16,442"
1462,"So, there may be no way to make you trust me.","01:36:17,200","01:36:19,680"
1463,But we need to go.,"01:36:19,960","01:36:21,371"
1464,Right.,"01:36:36,160","01:36:37,321"
1465,Well done.,"01:36:37,960","01:36:39,200"
1466,Three minutes.,"01:36:40,960","01:36:42,007"
1467,Get what you need.,"01:36:42,720","01:36:44,370"
1468,"Good evening, boss.","01:37:00,200","01:37:01,247"
1469,No way we all get through this.,"01:37:06,400","01:37:08,084"
1470,"If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost.","01:37:08,200","01:37:10,280"
1471,There's gonna be blood on the floor.,"01:37:11,000","01:37:12,440"
1472,I got no plans tomorrow night.,"01:37:12,480","01:37:13,891"
1473,I get first crack at the big guy.,"01:37:14,000","01:37:15,320"
1474,Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.,"01:37:15,760","01:37:17,250"
1475,That's true. He hates you the most.,"01:37:17,360","01:37:19,761"
1476,Ultron knows we're coming.,"01:37:25,080","01:37:27,242"
1477,Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.,"01:37:27,520","01:37:29,727"
1478,And that's what we signed up for.,"01:37:30,240","01:37:31,969"
1479,"But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.","01:37:32,240","01:37:34,766"
1480,So our priority,"01:37:35,880","01:37:37,370"
1481,is getting them out.,"01:37:38,080","01:37:39,161"
1482,We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!,"01:37:39,400","01:37:42,324"
1483,Get off your asses.,"01:37:50,120","01:37:51,565"
1484,All they want is to live their lives in peace.,"01:37:52,800","01:37:54,723"
1485,And that's not gonna happen today.,"01:37:55,280","01:37:56,640"
1486,But we can do our best to protect them.,"01:37:58,280","01:38:00,009"
1487,And we can get the job done.,"01:38:00,720","01:38:02,245"
1488,"We find out what Ultron's been building, we find Romanoff, and we clear the field.","01:38:05,640","01:38:12,803"
1489,Keep the fight between us.,"01:38:14,240","01:38:16,163"
1490,Ultron thinks we're monsters.,"01:38:22,880","01:38:25,281"
1491,That we're what's wrong with the world.,"01:38:25,800","01:38:28,201"
1492,This isn't just about beating him.,"01:38:28,320","01:38:30,641"
1493,It's about whether he's right.,"01:38:31,160","01:38:33,208"
1494,Natasha!,"01:38:39,680","01:38:40,727"
1495,Natasha!,"01:38:41,840","01:38:42,841"
1496,Bruce?,"01:38:43,000","01:38:44,081"
1497,You all right?,"01:38:45,520","01:38:46,521"
1498,Yeah.,"01:38:46,680","01:38:47,727"
1499,The team is in the city.,"01:38:47,840","01:38:49,569"
1500,It's about to light up.,"01:38:47,840","01:38:49,569"
1501,I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere.,"01:38:49,680","01:38:51,840"
1502,Yeah. I did.,"01:38:52,160","01:38:54,288"
1503,So what's our play?,"01:39:00,680","01:39:01,841"
1504,I'm here to get you to safety.,"01:39:02,040","01:39:03,405"
1505,Job's not finished.,"01:39:04,160","01:39:06,686"
1506,"We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians.","01:39:04,160","01:39:08,683"
1507,And you've done plenty.,"01:39:10,040","01:39:11,201"
1508,Our fight is over.,"01:39:13,600","01:39:15,090"
1509,"So, we just disappear?","01:39:16,480","01:39:18,721"
1510,Come on.,"01:39:22,880","01:39:24,723"
1511,"Your man's in the church, boss.","01:39:29,520","01:39:31,761"
1512,I think he's waiting for you.,"01:39:31,880","01:39:33,723"
1513,Come to confess your sins?,"01:39:37,800","01:39:39,848"
1514,I don't know. How much time you got?,"01:39:39,960","01:39:41,200"
1515,More than you.,"01:39:41,360","01:39:42,850"
1516,Have you been juicing?,"01:39:45,240","01:39:48,050"
1517,Little vibranium cocktail?,"01:39:45,240","01:39:48,050"
1518,You're looking...,"01:39:48,160","01:39:50,447"
1519,I don't wanna say puffy.,"01:39:48,160","01:39:50,447"
1520,You're stalling to protect the people.,"01:39:50,560","01:39:52,289"
1521,"Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?","01:39:52,680","01:39:55,524"
1522,I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free.,"01:39:55,840","01:39:58,320"
1523,What?,"01:40:03,080","01:40:04,127"
1524,You think you were the only one stalling?,"01:40:05,040","01:40:07,361"
1525,There's the rest of the vibranium.,"01:40:08,080","01:40:09,730"
1526,"Function, still unclear.","01:40:09,840","01:40:11,251"
1527,"This is how you end, Tony.","01:40:11,440","01:40:12,601"
1528,This is peace in my time.,"01:40:13,880","01:40:15,644"
1529,Go!,"01:40:32,360","01:40:33,407"
1530,Get off the bridge!,"01:40:38,960","01:40:40,291"
1531,Run!,"01:40:44,440","01:40:45,441"
1532,Ultron.,"01:40:47,440","01:40:49,249"
1533,My Vision.,"01:40:54,760","01:40:55,966"
1534,They really did take everything from me.,"01:40:56,200","01:40:58,487"
1535,You set the terms.,"01:40:58,640","01:41:00,688"
1536,You can change them.,"01:40:58,640","01:41:00,688"
1537,All right.,"01:41:00,800","01:41:02,040"
1538,"Friday, the Vision?","01:41:26,240","01:41:27,480"
1539,"Boss, it's working.","01:41:27,640","01:41:29,800"
1540,He's burning Ultron out of the net.,"01:41:27,640","01:41:29,800"
1541,He won't escape through there.,"01:41:29,840","01:41:31,040"
1542,You shut me out.,"01:41:36,120","01:41:37,451"
1543,You think I care?,"01:41:37,920","01:41:39,126"
1544,"You take away my world, I take away yours.","01:41:41,120","01:41:44,929"
1545,Friday.,"01:42:29,480","01:42:30,686"
1546,Sokovia is going for a ride.,"01:42:30,800","01:42:33,246"
1547,Do you see,"01:42:45,760","01:42:47,250"
1548,the beauty of it?,"01:42:47,720","01:42:49,245"
1549,The inevitability.,"01:42:49,840","01:42:51,683"
1550,"You rise, only to fall.","01:42:51,920","01:42:55,163"
1551,"You, Avengers, you are my meteor.","01:42:57,920","01:43:00,764"
1552,My swift and terrible sword.,"01:43:01,680","01:43:03,409"
1553,And the earth will crack,"01:43:03,600","01:43:05,090"
1554,with the weight of your failure.,"01:43:05,280","01:43:07,203"
1555,"Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me.","01:43:08,880","01:43:12,646"
1556,It means nothing.,"01:43:13,120","01:43:14,531"
1557,"When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world","01:43:15,600","01:43:19,009"
1558,will be metal.,"01:43:19,520","01:43:20,521"
1559,We gotta move.,"01:43:25,080","01:43:26,650"
1560,You're not gonna turn green?,"01:43:26,960","01:43:28,080"
1561,I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.,"01:43:28,280","01:43:30,200"
1562,I adore you.,"01:43:31,360","01:43:32,646"
1563,But I need the other guy.,"01:43:41,280","01:43:43,203"
1564,Let's finish the job.,"01:43:48,040","01:43:49,804"
1565,I really hope this makes us even.,"01:44:06,600","01:44:08,011"
1566,Now go be a hero.,"01:44:10,320","01:44:12,368"
1567,The vibranium core's got a magnetic field.,"01:44:20,840","01:44:22,763"
1568,That's what's keeping the rock together.,"01:44:22,920","01:44:24,922"
1569,If it drops?,"01:44:25,040","01:44:26,087"
1570,"Right now, the impact will kill thousands.","01:44:26,160","01:44:27,491"
1571,Once it gets high enough?,"01:44:27,560","01:44:30,291"
1572,Global extinction.,"01:44:27,560","01:44:30,291"
1573,That building's not clear. The 10th floor.,"01:44:34,600","01:44:36,682"
1574,Hi.,"01:44:41,560","01:44:42,561"
1575,Okay. Get in the tub!,"01:44:43,680","01:44:46,047"
1576,"I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.","01:44:52,880","01:44:54,723"
1577,"Cap, you got incoming.","01:44:57,520","01:44:58,726"
1578,Incoming already came in.,"01:44:58,880","01:45:00,530"
1579,"Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely.","01:45:03,200","01:45:05,680"
1580,"The rest of us have one job, tear these things apart.","01:45:06,400","01:45:09,521"
1581,"You get hurt, hurt them back.","01:45:09,840","01:45:11,444"
1582,"You get killed, walk it off.","01:45:12,120","01:45:15,606"
1583,"Go, go, go!","01:45:50,040","01:45:51,246"
1584,How could I let this happen?,"01:45:56,920","01:45:58,684"
1585,"Hey, hey, you okay?","01:45:58,800","01:46:00,848"
1586,This is all our fault.,"01:45:58,800","01:46:00,848"
1587,"Hey, look at me.","01:46:01,040","01:46:03,240"
1588,"It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.","01:46:01,040","01:46:03,240"
1589,Who cares?,"01:46:03,280","01:46:04,327"
1590,Are you up for this?,"01:46:04,440","01:46:05,965"
1591,Are you?,"01:46:06,080","01:46:07,161"
1592,"Look, I just need to know.","01:46:07,400","01:46:10,807"
1593,Because the city is flying.,"01:46:07,400","01:46:10,807"
1594,"Okay. Look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow.","01:46:11,120","01:46:17,126"
1595,None of this makes sense.,"01:46:17,280","01:46:18,361"
1596,But I'm going back out there because it's my job.,"01:46:21,640","01:46:23,768"
1597,Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.,"01:46:24,640","01:46:27,291"
1598,It doesn't matter what you did or what you were.,"01:46:27,440","01:46:30,444"
1599,"If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill.","01:46:30,640","01:46:33,246"
1600,"Stay in here, you're good.","01:46:34,280","01:46:36,920"
1601,I'll send your brother to come find you.,"01:46:34,280","01:46:36,920"
1602,"But if you step out that door, you are an Avenger.","01:46:36,960","01:46:40,721"
1603,All right. Good chat.,"01:46:45,600","01:46:47,409"
1604,"Yeah, the city is flying.","01:46:51,160","01:46:52,207"
1605,I got you!,"01:47:26,200","01:47:27,361"
1606,Just look at me!,"01:47:27,680","01:47:28,920"
1607,You can't save them all.,"01:47:35,680","01:47:37,011"
1608,You'll never...,"01:47:38,360","01:47:39,407"
1609,Never what? You didn't finish!,"01:47:40,680","01:47:43,126"
1610,"What, were you napping?","01:47:46,880","01:47:48,450"
1611,Thor.,"01:48:09,920","01:48:11,001"
1612,You're bothering me.,"01:48:13,600","01:48:15,204"
1613,"All right, we're all clear here.","01:48:50,600","01:48:51,880"
1614,We are not clear!,"01:48:51,960","01:48:53,007"
1615,We are very not clear!,"01:48:53,120","01:48:54,531"
1616,"All right, coming to you.","01:48:57,600","01:48:58,931"
1617,"Keep up, old man!","01:48:59,400","01:49:01,482"
1618,Nobody would know.,"01:49:03,240","01:49:04,765"
1619,Nobody.,"01:49:05,600","01:49:06,647"
1620,"The last I saw him, an Ultron was sitting on him.","01:49:08,600","01:49:11,524"
1621,"Yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard.","01:49:11,640","01:49:13,529"
1622,I miss him already.,"01:49:13,600","01:49:14,601"
1623,Hold your fire!,"01:49:30,160","01:49:31,321"
1624,Romanoff!,"01:49:41,200","01:49:42,247"
1625,Thanks!,"01:49:42,760","01:49:43,761"
1626,The antigravs are rigged to flip.,"01:49:53,160","01:49:54,764"
1627,"Touch them, they'll go full reverse thrust.","01:49:54,880","01:49:57,042"
1628,The city's not coming down slow.,"01:49:57,160","01:49:58,605"
1629,Spire is vibranium.,"01:49:58,720","01:49:59,846"
1630,If I get Thor to hit it...,"01:49:59,960","01:50:01,086"
1631,It will crack. That's not enough.,"01:50:01,360","01:50:02,725"
1632,The impact would still be devastating.,"01:50:02,840","01:50:04,365"
1633,Maybe if we can cap the other end.,"01:50:04,520","01:50:05,880"
1634,Keep the atomic action doubling back.,"01:50:06,040","01:50:07,690"
1635,That could vaporise the city.,"01:50:07,840","01:50:09,205"
1636,And everyone on it.,"01:50:10,200","01:50:12,043"
1637,The next wave is gonna hit any minute.,"01:50:17,880","01:50:19,723"
1638,"What do you got, Stark?","01:50:19,880","01:50:21,848"
1639,Nothing great.,"01:50:19,880","01:50:21,848"
1640,Maybe a way to blow up the city.,"01:50:22,640","01:50:24,881"
1641,"That'll keep it from impacting the surface, if you guys can get clear.","01:50:25,000","01:50:27,447"
1642,"I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.","01:50:27,720","01:50:29,609"
1643,Impact radius is getting bigger every second.,"01:50:29,840","01:50:32,730"
1644,We're gonna have to make a choice.,"01:50:32,920","01:50:34,285"
1645,"Cap, these people are going nowhere.","01:50:35,040","01:50:36,565"
1646,If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...,"01:50:37,400","01:50:40,200"
1647,Not till everyone's safe.,"01:50:37,400","01:50:40,200"
1648,Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.,"01:50:40,600","01:50:43,604"
1649,I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.,"01:50:43,840","01:50:45,800"
1650,I didn't say we should leave.,"01:50:45,840","01:50:47,285"
1651,There's worse ways to go.,"01:50:50,120","01:50:51,929"
1652,Where else am I gonna get a view like this?,"01:50:57,400","01:50:59,846"
1653,"Glad you like the view, Romanoff.","01:51:00,720","01:51:03,326"
1654,It's about to get better.,"01:51:03,440","01:51:05,044"
1655,"Nice, right?","01:51:29,160","01:51:30,366"
1656,Pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.,"01:51:30,480","01:51:32,926"
1657,"She's dusty, but she'll do.","01:51:33,080","01:51:34,730"
1658,"Fury, you son of a bitch.","01:51:35,080","01:51:36,525"
1659,Ooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?,"01:51:36,680","01:51:38,967"
1660,"Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.","01:51:39,080","01:51:41,287"
1661,Lifeboats secure to deploy.,"01:51:41,440","01:51:42,965"
1662,"Disengage in three, two...","01:51:43,080","01:51:45,765"
1663,Take them out.,"01:51:46,960","01:51:47,961"
1664,This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?,"01:51:57,640","01:51:59,165"
1665,This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.,"01:51:59,280","01:52:01,726"
1666,is supposed to be.,"01:51:59,280","01:52:01,726"
1667,This is not so bad.,"01:52:03,400","01:52:04,811"
1668,Let's load them up.,"01:52:08,080","01:52:09,411"
1669,"Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.","01:52:14,800","01:52:18,641"
1670,Show 'em what we got.,"01:52:19,000","01:52:20,206"
1671,You're up.,"01:52:20,560","01:52:21,561"
1672,Yes!,"01:52:26,840","01:52:27,841"
1673,Now this is gonna be a good story.,"01:52:28,080","01:52:29,844"
1674,Yup. If you live to tell it.,"01:52:32,480","01:52:34,562"
1675,You think I can't hold my own?,"01:52:34,720","01:52:36,722"
1676,"We get through this, I'll hold your own.","01:52:36,840","01:52:38,440"
1677,You had to make it weird.,"01:52:38,520","01:52:40,363"
1678,I got about 50 to 100 more coming in after this group.,"01:52:45,200","01:52:48,170"
1679,Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.,"01:53:05,120","01:53:06,531"
1680,"Let's go, everyone!","01:53:06,880","01:53:07,961"
1681,Number six boat is topped and locked...,"01:53:10,480","01:53:12,482"
1682,Or stocked... Topped...,"01:53:12,600","01:53:15,001"
1683,It's full of people.,"01:53:15,520","01:53:16,965"
1684,Incoming!,"01:53:18,720","01:53:19,801"
1685,"Oh, God!","01:53:22,840","01:53:23,887"
1686,You think you're saving anyone?,"01:53:34,400","01:53:35,640"
1687,I turn that key and drop this rock a little early,"01:53:37,520","01:53:39,522"
1688,and it's still billions dead.,"01:53:39,680","01:53:41,762"
1689,Even you can't stop that.,"01:53:42,240","01:53:43,401"
1690,"I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast...","01:53:43,560","01:53:48,401"
1691,I am running out of things to say!,"01:53:48,520","01:53:52,081"
1692,Are you ready?,"01:53:48,520","01:53:52,081"
1693,It's terribly wellbalanced.,"01:53:59,760","01:54:00,886"
1694,"Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so...","01:54:01,240","01:54:04,722"
1695,I got it. Create a heat seal.,"01:54:05,680","01:54:08,331"
1696,I could...,"01:54:08,760","01:54:09,807"
1697,I could supercharge the spire from below.,"01:54:09,880","01:54:12,281"
1698,Running numbers.,"01:54:12,440","01:54:13,487"
1699,A heat seal could work with enough power.,"01:54:23,600","01:54:25,284"
1700,"Thor, I got a plan.","01:54:25,760","01:54:27,762"
1701,We're out of time.,"01:54:25,760","01:54:27,762"
1702,They're coming for the core.,"01:54:27,960","01:54:29,166"
1703,"Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.","01:54:29,280","01:54:31,089"
1704,On it.,"01:54:31,240","01:54:34,449"
1705,"Avengers, time to work for a living.","01:54:31,240","01:54:34,449"
1706,Are you good?,"01:54:43,560","01:54:44,800"
1707,Yeah.,"01:54:43,560","01:54:44,800"
1708,Romanoff.,"01:54:46,280","01:54:47,327"
1709,You and Banner better not be playing hide the zucchini.,"01:54:47,480","01:54:49,881"
1710,"Relax, shellhead.","01:54:49,960","01:54:51,041"
1711,Not all of us can fly.,"01:54:51,440","01:54:52,885"
1712,What's the drill?,"01:54:58,640","01:55:00,324"
1713,This is the drill.,"01:54:58,640","01:55:00,324"
1714,"If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.","01:55:00,480","01:55:02,642"
1715,Is that the best you can do?,"01:55:07,240","01:55:09,242"
1716,You had to ask.,"01:55:19,120","01:55:20,690"
1717,This is the best I can do.,"01:55:20,800","01:55:23,121"
1718,This is exactly what I wanted.,"01:55:23,240","01:55:24,890"
1719,All of you,"01:55:25,240","01:55:26,571"
1720,against all of me.,"01:55:26,680","01:55:28,330"
1721,How can you possibly hope to stop me?,"01:55:28,600","01:55:30,807"
1722,"Well, like the old man said...","01:55:31,680","01:55:33,523"
1723,Together.,"01:55:34,840","01:55:35,841"
1724,"You know, with the benefit of hindsight...","01:57:04,760","01:57:07,161"
1725,They'll try to leave the city.,"01:57:16,440","01:57:17,441"
1726,"We can't let them, not even one. Rhodey.","01:57:17,600","01:57:19,284"
1727,I'm on it.,"01:57:19,640","01:57:20,721"
1728,No. I didn't say you could leave.,"01:57:21,120","01:57:22,485"
1729,War Machine coming at you! Right...,"01:57:23,120","01:57:25,202"
1730,"Okay, what?","01:57:31,600","01:57:32,965"
1731,We gotta move out.,"01:57:33,200","01:57:35,202"
1732,Even I can tell the air is getting thin.,"01:57:33,200","01:57:35,202"
1733,You guys get to the boats.,"01:57:35,360","01:57:36,646"
1734,I'll sweep for stragglers.,"01:57:36,800","01:57:38,640"
1735,Be right behind you.,"01:57:36,800","01:57:38,640"
1736,What about the core?,"01:57:38,800","01:57:41,246"
1737,I'll protect it.,"01:57:38,800","01:57:41,246"
1738,It's my job.,"01:57:43,040","01:57:44,201"
1739,Nat.,"01:57:45,320","01:57:46,481"
1740,This way.,"01:57:46,760","01:57:47,761"
1741,Get the people on the boats.,"01:57:52,160","01:57:53,321"
1742,I'm not going to leave you here.,"01:57:53,480","01:57:54,481"
1743,I can handle this.,"01:57:54,640","01:57:55,687"
1744,Come back for me when everyone else is off.,"01:57:58,000","01:57:59,240"
1745,Not before.,"01:57:59,480","01:58:00,970"
1746,You understand?,"01:58:01,600","01:58:02,726"
1747,"You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.","01:58:03,760","01:58:05,444"
1748,Go.,"01:58:05,840","01:58:06,921"
1749,"Boss, power levels are way below...","01:58:08,480","01:58:10,005"
1750,Reroute everything.,"01:58:10,120","01:58:12,282"
1751,We get one shot at this.,"01:58:10,120","01:58:12,282"
1752,I know what I need to do.,"01:58:17,240","01:58:18,526"
1753,The dining room.,"01:58:18,840","01:58:19,887"
1754,"If I knock out that east wall, it'd make a nice workspace for Laura, huh?","01:58:20,160","01:58:23,720"
1755,Put up some baffling.,"01:58:25,200","01:58:26,361"
1756,She can't hear the kids running around.,"01:58:26,480","01:58:28,761"
1757,What do you think?,"01:58:26,480","01:58:28,761"
1758,You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.,"01:58:28,800","01:58:29,881"
1759,No one eats in a dining room.,"01:58:30,040","01:58:31,565"
1760,We don't have a lot of time.,"01:58:37,240","01:58:38,360"
1761,So get your ass on a boat.,"01:58:38,960","01:58:40,928"

1767,Costel!,"01:59:05,960","01:59:07,246"
1768,We were in the market.,"01:59:08,320","01:59:09,446"
1769,Costel!,"01:59:09,560","01:59:10,607"
1770,"Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.","01:59:25,320","01:59:27,368"
1771,Is this the last of them?,"01:59:27,480","01:59:28,925"
1772,Yeah.,"01:59:27,480","01:59:28,925"
1773,Everyone else is on the carrier.,"01:59:29,360","01:59:31,641"
1774,"You know, this works, we maybe don't walk away.","01:59:29,360","01:59:33,651"
1775,Maybe not.,"01:59:34,360","01:59:35,361"
1776,"I got no strings, so I have fun","01:59:54,600","01:59:58,127"
1777,I'm not tied up to anyone,"01:59:58,600","02:00:01,285"
1778,Come on. Time to go.,"02:00:02,880","02:00:04,211"
1779,You didn't see that coming?,"02:00:36,640","02:00:38,688"
1780,For God's sake.,"02:01:34,960","02:01:36,724"
1781,Zrinka!,"02:01:53,000","02:01:54,764"
1782,Costel! Baby!,"02:01:53,000","02:01:54,764"
1783,"No, no, I'm fine.","02:02:07,240","02:02:08,241"

1787,"If you stay here, you'll die.","02:02:29,760","02:02:33,003"
1788,I just did.,"02:02:34,600","02:02:35,965"
1789,Do you know how it felt?,"02:02:36,760","02:02:38,524"
1790,It felt like that.,"02:02:52,600","02:02:54,967"
1791,"Thor, on my mark.","02:03:29,960","02:03:31,610"
1792,Now!,"02:03:46,680","02:03:47,681"
1793,"Hey, big guy. We did it.","02:04:15,680","02:04:18,126"
1794,The job is finished.,"02:04:19,160","02:04:20,844"
1795,"Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay?","02:04:21,040","02:04:23,725"
1796,We can't track you in stealth mode.,"02:04:28,040","02:04:29,849"
1797,So help me out. I need you...,"02:04:31,960","02:04:34,088"
1798,You're afraid.,"02:05:19,760","02:05:20,761"
1799,Of you?,"02:05:21,760","02:05:22,841"
1800,Of death.,"02:05:23,520","02:05:24,681"
1801,You're the last one.,"02:05:25,400","02:05:27,209"
1802,You were supposed to be the last.,"02:05:27,440","02:05:29,886"
1803,Stark asked for a saviour,"02:05:30,120","02:05:32,407"
1804,and settled for a slave.,"02:05:33,440","02:05:35,124"
1805,I suppose we are both disappointments.,"02:05:35,240","02:05:37,641"
1806,I suppose we are.,"02:05:40,120","02:05:41,360"
1807,Humans are odd.,"02:05:42,080","02:05:43,241"
1808,They think order and chaos are somehow opposites,"02:05:45,080","02:05:48,721"
1809,and try to control what won't be.,"02:05:50,480","02:05:51,811"
1810,But there is grace in their failings.,"02:05:53,520","02:05:55,966"
1811,I think you missed that.,"02:05:56,280","02:05:58,203"
1812,They're doomed.,"02:05:58,880","02:05:59,961"
1813,Yes.,"02:06:00,880","02:06:01,927"
1814,But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.,"02:06:06,160","02:06:09,084"
1815,It's a privilege to be among them.,"02:06:11,160","02:06:13,162"
1816,You're unbearably naive.,"02:06:13,400","02:06:15,926"
1817,Well...,"02:06:16,200","02:06:17,406"
1818,I was born yesterday.,"02:06:19,480","02:06:21,528"
1819,Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!,"02:07:34,160","02:07:36,242"
1820,Fat.,"02:07:37,600","02:07:38,601"
1821,One of our tech boys flagged this.,"02:07:39,720","02:07:41,080"
1822,Splashed down in the Banda Sea.,"02:07:42,200","02:07:44,362"
1823,Could be the Quinjet.,"02:07:45,480","02:07:47,005"
1824,"But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.","02:07:47,360","02:07:50,730"
1825,Right.,"02:07:52,280","02:07:53,645"
1826,Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.,"02:07:54,080","02:07:56,321"
1827,He'll send a postcard.,"02:07:57,600","02:07:59,489"
1828,Wish you were here.,"02:07:59,760","02:08:01,489"
1829,You sent me to recruit him way back when.,"02:08:03,440","02:08:06,728"
1830,Did you know then what was gonna happen?,"02:08:08,560","02:08:11,131"
1831,You never know.,"02:08:13,320","02:08:15,243"
1832,"You hope for the best, then make do with what you get.","02:08:15,440","02:08:18,967"
1833,I got a great team.,"02:08:19,440","02:08:20,930"
1834,Nothing lasts forever.,"02:08:22,040","02:08:24,008"
1835,"Trouble, Ms Romanoff.","02:08:24,280","02:08:26,328"
1836,"No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.","02:08:26,560","02:08:29,928"
1837,The rules have changed.,"02:08:33,800","02:08:35,006"
1838,We're dealing with something new.,"02:08:35,200","02:08:36,804"
1839,The Vision is artificial intelligence.,"02:08:36,960","02:08:38,246"
1840,A machine.,"02:08:38,360","02:08:40,283"
1841,"So, it doesn't count?","02:08:38,360","02:08:40,283"
1842,"No, it's not like a person lifting the hammer.","02:08:40,480","02:08:42,289"
1843,"Right, different rules for us.","02:08:42,560","02:08:44,210"
1844,Nice guy. Artificial.,"02:08:44,440","02:08:45,487"
1845,Thank you.,"02:08:44,440","02:08:45,487"
1846,"He can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone.","02:08:45,680","02:08:48,570"
1847,It's safe with the Vision.,"02:08:49,480","02:08:51,562"
1848,"And these days, safe is in short supply.","02:08:51,800","02:08:54,326"
1849,But if you put the hammer in an elevator...,"02:08:56,360","02:08:58,328"
1850,It would still go up.,"02:08:58,440","02:09:00,320"
1851,Elevator's not worthy.,"02:08:58,440","02:09:00,320"
1852,I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.,"02:09:00,360","02:09:02,169"
1853,Not if you don't leave.,"02:09:02,320","02:09:03,845"
1854,I have no choice.,"02:09:04,080","02:09:05,809"
1855,The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones,"02:09:06,040","02:09:08,202"
1856,to show up in the last few years.,"02:09:08,320","02:09:09,731"
1857,It's not a coincidence.,"02:09:09,840","02:09:11,410"
1858,Someone has been playing an intricate game,"02:09:12,240","02:09:14,004"
1859,and has made pawns of us.,"02:09:14,160","02:09:15,810"
1860,And once all these pieces are in position...,"02:09:15,920","02:09:17,809"
1861,Triple Yahtzee.,"02:09:17,920","02:09:19,331"

1863,I do.,"02:09:21,120","02:09:22,201"
1864,"Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained.","02:09:23,040","02:09:27,007"
1865,That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.,"02:09:34,320","02:09:36,846"
1866,"I'm gonna miss him, though.","02:09:40,000","02:09:42,606"
1867,And you're gonna miss me.,"02:09:40,000","02:09:42,606"
1868,There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.,"02:09:42,720","02:09:44,290"

1870,Yeah?,"02:09:48,360","02:09:49,361"
1871,"Well, it's time for me to tap out.","02:09:49,520","02:09:51,966"
1872,Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book.,"02:09:52,200","02:09:54,362"
1873,"Build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.","02:09:54,520","02:09:57,444"

1879,I think someone else came out.,"02:10:10,400","02:10:12,243"
1880,You all right?,"02:10:16,200","02:10:17,281"
1881,I'm home.,"02:10:19,960","02:10:21,405"
1882,"You wanna keep staring at the wall, or do you wanna go to work?","02:10:29,320","02:10:32,085"
1883,"I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.","02:10:32,240","02:10:33,571"
1884,I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes.,"02:10:33,760","02:10:36,764"
1885,How do we look?,"02:10:36,840","02:10:37,887"
1886,"Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.","02:10:38,120","02:10:40,407"
1887,We got some hitters.,"02:10:40,560","02:10:42,244"
1888,They're good. They're not a team.,"02:10:42,400","02:10:44,801"
