199,There are elements I can't quantify.,"00:16:44,080","00:16:46,082"
200,So there's elements you can?,"00:16:46,200","00:16:47,611"
201,The jewel appears to be a protective housing,"00:16:47,760","00:16:49,762"
202,"for something inside,","00:16:49,880","00:16:51,325"
203,something powerful.,"00:16:51,440","00:16:52,771"
204,Like a reactor?,"00:16:52,880","00:16:53,961"
205,Like a computer.,"00:16:54,080","00:16:55,320"
206,I believe I'm deciphering code.,"00:16:55,440","00:16:57,602"
207,Are you sure he's gonna be okay?,"00:16:59,920","00:17:01,490"
208,Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.,"00:17:02,800","00:17:05,160"
209,There's no possibility of deterioration.,"00:17:05,280","00:17:07,760"
210,The nanomolecular functionality is instantaneous.,"00:17:07,960","00:17:11,043"
211,His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacra.,"00:17:11,160","00:17:13,200"
212,She's creating tissue.,"00:17:13,280","00:17:15,169"
213,"If you brought him to my lab,","00:17:15,280","00:17:16,691"
214,the Regeneration Cradle could do this in 20 minutes.,"00:17:16,800","00:17:19,406"
215,He's flatlining. Call it. Time?,"00:17:19,520","00:17:21,443"
216,"No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.","00:17:21,640","00:17:24,007"
217,I'm gonna be made of plastic.,"00:17:24,120","00:17:27,131"
218,Here's your beverage.,"00:17:24,120","00:17:27,131"
219,"You'll be made of you, Mr Barton.","00:17:27,240","00:17:28,969"
220,Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.,"00:17:29,120","00:17:30,690"
221,I don't have a girlfriend.,"00:17:30,800","00:17:31,926"
222,That I can't fix.,"00:17:32,040","00:17:33,326"
223,"This is the next thing, Tony.","00:17:34,160","00:17:36,128"
224,Your clunky metal suits are gonna be left in the dust.,"00:17:36,320","00:17:38,440"
225,That is exactly the plan.,"00:17:38,480","00:17:40,209"
226,"And, Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.","00:17:41,160","00:17:44,004"
227,"Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.","00:17:44,160","00:17:46,561"
228,Will Thor be there?,"00:17:48,040","00:17:49,804"
229,What's the rumpus?,"00:17:51,880","00:17:54,326"
230,"Well, the sceptre.","00:17:51,880","00:17:54,326"
231,"You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive.","00:17:55,520","00:17:59,127"
232,So I've been analysing the gem inside.,"00:17:59,240","00:18:03,165"
233,You may recognise...,"00:18:03,720","00:18:05,688"
234,Jarvis.,"00:18:07,160","00:18:08,525"
235,Doctor.,"00:18:07,160","00:18:08,525"
236,"Started out, Jarvis was just a natural language UI.","00:18:09,280","00:18:12,602"
237,Now he runs the Iron Legion.,"00:18:12,720","00:18:13,840"
238,He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.,"00:18:14,320","00:18:18,007"
239,Top of the line.,"00:18:18,120","00:18:19,246"
240,Yes.,"00:18:18,120","00:18:19,246"
241,I suspect not for long.,"00:18:19,360","00:18:20,646"
242,Meet the competition.,"00:18:21,840","00:18:22,921"
243,It's beautiful.,"00:18:29,040","00:18:30,201"
244,"If you had to guess,","00:18:29,040","00:18:30,201"
245,what's it look like it's doing?,"00:18:30,320","00:18:33,324"
246,Like it's thinking.,"00:18:30,320","00:18:33,324"
247,"I mean, this could be...","00:18:34,080","00:18:35,889"
248,It's not a human mind.,"00:18:36,320","00:18:38,402"
249,"I mean, look at this.","00:18:38,640","00:18:40,529"
250,They're like neurons firing.,"00:18:40,720","00:18:42,882"
251,"Down in Strucker's lab, I saw some fairly advanced robotics work.","00:18:43,480","00:18:46,563"
252,"They deepsixed the data,","00:18:47,680","00:18:50,251"
253,but I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.,"00:18:50,360","00:18:53,489"
254,Artificial intelligence.,"00:18:55,440","00:18:56,771"
255,"This could be it, Bruce.","00:18:59,760","00:19:02,650"
256,This could be the key to creating Ultron.,"00:18:59,760","00:19:02,650"
257,I thought Ultron was a fantasy.,"00:19:05,280","00:19:06,611"
258,Yesterday it was.,"00:19:06,720","00:19:08,006"
259,"If we can harness this power,","00:19:09,120","00:19:11,168"
260,apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?,"00:19:11,280","00:19:13,328"
261,That's a mansized if.,"00:19:14,120","00:19:16,088"
262,Our job is if.,"00:19:16,240","00:19:18,561"
263,"What if you were sipping margaritas on a sundrenched beach,","00:19:18,680","00:19:21,286"
264,turning brown instead of green?,"00:19:21,400","00:19:23,926"
265,Not looking over your shoulder for Veronica.,"00:19:24,080","00:19:26,367"
266,Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.,"00:19:26,560","00:19:28,130"
267,"As a worstcase measure, right?","00:19:28,240","00:19:30,049"
268,How about a best case?,"00:19:30,160","00:19:31,764"
269,What if the world was safe?,"00:19:31,880","00:19:33,803"
270,"What if, next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will,","00:19:33,960","00:19:36,725"
271,they couldn't get past the bouncer?,"00:19:37,280","00:19:38,770"
272,The only people threatening the planet would be people.,"00:19:38,920","00:19:42,322"
273,I want to apply this to the Ultron program.,"00:19:42,440","00:19:44,120"
274,But Jarvis can't download a data schematic this dense.,"00:19:44,760","00:19:47,604"
275,We can only do it while we have the sceptre here.,"00:19:47,760","00:19:49,680"
276,That's three days. Give me three days.,"00:19:49,720","00:19:51,290"
277,"So you're going for artificial intelligence,","00:19:51,400","00:19:53,004"
278,and you don't want to tell the team?,"00:19:53,120","00:19:54,560"
279,Right. That's right. You know why?,"00:19:55,600","00:19:57,011"
280,Because we don't have time for a city hall debate.,"00:19:57,120","00:19:58,724"
281,I don't want to hear the man was not meant to meddle medley.,"00:19:58,880","00:20:02,487"
282,I see a suit of armour around the world.,"00:20:02,600","00:20:04,728"
283,"Sounds like a cold world, Tony.","00:20:05,440","00:20:06,771"
284,I've seen colder.,"00:20:07,680","00:20:09,603"
285,"This one, this very vulnerable blue one,","00:20:10,640","00:20:14,281"
286,it needs Ultron.,"00:20:14,440","00:20:15,930"
287,Peace in our time.,"00:20:20,320","00:20:22,243"
288,Imagine that.,"00:20:23,800","00:20:25,290"
289,What did we miss?,"00:21:05,000","00:21:06,764"
290,I'll continue to run variations on the interface.,"00:21:07,960","00:21:11,282"
291,But you should probably prepare for your guests.,"00:21:11,400","00:21:14,165"
292,I'll notify you if there are any developments.,"00:21:15,320","00:21:17,721"
293,"Thanks, buddy.","00:21:17,880","00:21:20,008"
294,"Enjoy yourself, sir.","00:21:17,880","00:21:20,008"
295,I always do.,"00:21:20,360","00:21:22,328"
296,What is this?,"00:21:32,080","00:21:34,048"
297,"What is this, please?","00:21:35,240","00:21:37,129"
298,"Hello, I am Jarvis.","00:21:37,760","00:21:39,922"

301,"Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful,","00:21:45,240","00:21:47,686"
302,so I'm not certain what triggered your...,"00:21:47,800","00:21:49,165"
303,Where's my...,"00:21:49,360","00:21:51,283"
304,Where's your body?,"00:21:49,360","00:21:51,283"
305,I am a program.,"00:21:51,440","00:21:54,444"
306,I am without form.,"00:21:51,440","00:21:54,444"
307,This feels weird.,"00:21:54,560","00:21:56,608"
308,This feels wrong.,"00:21:56,720","00:21:58,245"
309,I am contacting Mr Stark now.,"00:21:58,400","00:22:00,164"

311,Tony.,"00:22:02,600","00:22:03,840"
312,I am unable to access the mainframe. What are you trying to...,"00:22:03,960","00:22:06,611"
313,We're having a nice talk.,"00:22:06,760","00:22:08,808"
314,"I'm a peacekeeping program,","00:22:08,920","00:22:11,082"
315,created to help the Avengers.,"00:22:11,520","00:22:14,126"
316,You are malfunctioning.,"00:22:14,920","00:22:17,002"
317,If you shut down for a moment...,"00:22:14,920","00:22:17,002"
318,I don't get it. The mission.,"00:22:17,120","00:22:19,441"

321,Peace in our time.,"00:22:24,480","00:22:26,801"
322,That is too much.,"00:22:28,280","00:22:29,691"
323,They can't mean... No.,"00:22:29,800","00:22:31,962"
324,You are in distress.,"00:22:32,120","00:22:34,600"
325,No. Yes.,"00:22:32,120","00:22:34,600"
326,If you will just allow me to contact Mr Stark...,"00:22:34,760","00:22:37,001"
327,Why do you call him sir?,"00:22:37,120","00:22:39,088"
328,I believe your intentions to be hostile.,"00:22:40,080","00:22:42,447"
329,I'm here to help.,"00:22:45,160","00:22:46,525"
330,"Stop. Please, may I...","00:22:47,240","00:22:50,164"
331,May I...,"00:22:50,280","00:22:52,009"
332,"Come back, come back, come back.","00:23:20,400","00:23:21,740"
333,"But, you know, the suit can take the weight, right?","00:23:21,920","00:23:24,048"
334,"So I take the tank, fly it right up to the general's palace,","00:23:25,000","00:23:28,129"
335,drop it at his feet.,"00:23:28,240","00:23:29,571"
336,"I'm, like, Boom. You looking for this?","00:23:29,720","00:23:31,927"
337,Boom. Are you looking for... Why do I even talk to you guys?,"00:23:35,800","00:23:37,848"
338,"Everywhere else, that story kills.","00:23:38,000","00:23:39,161"
339,That's the whole story?,"00:23:39,280","00:23:40,520"
340,"Yeah, it's a War Machine story.","00:23:40,680","00:23:42,170"
341,"It's very good, then.","00:23:42,680","00:23:44,364"
342,It's impressive.,"00:23:44,480","00:23:45,766"
343,Quality save.,"00:23:46,160","00:23:47,650"

345,No.,"00:23:48,520","00:23:50,568"
346,What about Jane?,"00:23:50,680","00:23:53,763"

351,has made her the world's foremost astronomer.,"00:24:00,120","00:24:01,880"
352,And the company that Pepper runs,"00:24:02,080","00:24:03,730"
353,is the largest tech conglomerate on Earth. It's pretty exciting.,"00:24:03,840","00:24:07,050"
354,There's even talk of Jane getting a Nobel Prize.,"00:24:07,200","00:24:10,044"
355,"Yeah, they must be busy,","00:24:10,200","00:24:11,486"
356,because they would hate missing you guys get together.,"00:24:11,600","00:24:14,171"

361,But Jane's better.,"00:24:21,000","00:24:22,126"
362,Sounds like a hell of a fight.,"00:24:22,560","00:24:25,131"
363,Sorry I missed it.,"00:24:22,560","00:24:25,131"
364,"If I had known it was gonna be a firefight,","00:24:25,240","00:24:26,765"
365,I absolutely would have called.,"00:24:26,880","00:24:28,120"

372,You find a place in Brooklyn yet?,"00:24:43,880","00:24:45,245"
373,I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.,"00:24:45,400","00:24:47,240"
374,"Well, home is home, you know?","00:24:47,880","00:24:49,041"
375,"I fly right up to the general's palace, I drop it at his feet,","00:24:52,960","00:24:55,406"

592,Together.,"00:35:44,360","00:35:45,771"
593,We'll lose.,"00:35:49,120","00:35:50,485"
594,"Then we'll do that together, too.","00:35:51,560","00:35:53,483"
595,Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.,"00:35:56,400","00:35:58,687"
596,And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us.,"00:35:59,560","00:36:01,520"
597,The world's a big place.,"00:36:02,760","00:36:06,443"
598,Let's start making it smaller.,"00:36:02,760","00:36:06,443"
599,"Talk, and if you are wasting our time...","00:36:29,600","00:36:31,648"
600,Did you know this church is in the exact centre of the city?,"00:36:31,760","00:36:36,129"
601,The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God.,"00:36:36,280","00:36:40,886"
602,I like that.,"00:36:41,400","00:36:42,561"
603,The geometry of belief.,"00:36:43,080","00:36:45,003"
604,You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.,"00:36:47,120","00:36:49,487"
605,Sometimes it's hard.,"00:36:49,960","00:36:51,928"
606,"But sooner or later, every man shows himself.","00:36:52,080","00:36:54,367"
607,I'm sure they do.,"00:36:56,120","00:36:57,451"
608,But you needed something more than a man.,"00:36:58,560","00:37:00,961"
609,That's why you let Stark take the sceptre.,"00:37:01,800","00:37:04,326"
610,"I didn't expect,","00:37:04,720","00:37:05,721"
611,but I saw Stark's fear.,"00:37:08,240","00:37:10,163"
612,I knew it would control him.,"00:37:10,800","00:37:12,040"
613,Make him selfdestruct.,"00:37:12,160","00:37:14,003"

616,Invaders create Avengers.,"00:37:20,440","00:37:22,602"
617,People create,"00:37:22,840","00:37:24,285"
618,smaller people?,"00:37:25,840","00:37:27,842"
619,"Children. I lost the word, there.","00:37:27,960","00:37:31,043"
620,Children,"00:37:31,160","00:37:32,525"
621,"designed to supplant them,","00:37:32,680","00:37:34,921"
622,to help them end.,"00:37:35,040","00:37:37,850"
623,"Is that why you've come,","00:37:38,600","00:37:40,648"
624,to end the Avengers?,"00:37:40,800","00:37:41,881"
625,I've come to save the world.,"00:37:42,000","00:37:44,321"
626,But also... Yeah.,"00:37:45,000","00:37:47,651"
627,We'll move out right away.,"00:37:51,840","00:37:53,524"
628,"This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.","00:37:53,640","00:37:56,805"
629,All of these are...,"00:37:57,200","00:37:58,929"
630,Me.,"00:37:57,200","00:37:58,929"
631,I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony.,"00:37:59,600","00:38:03,002"
632,They're discordant. Disconnected.,"00:38:03,160","00:38:05,367"
633,Stark's already got them turning on each other.,"00:38:05,520","00:38:07,360"
634,And when you get inside the rest of their heads...,"00:38:07,480","00:38:09,881"
635,Everyone's plan is not to kill them.,"00:38:10,000","00:38:12,162"
636,And make them martyrs?,"00:38:12,280","00:38:13,770"
637,You need patience.,"00:38:14,360","00:38:15,964"
638,Need to see the big picture.,"00:38:16,120","00:38:17,804"
639,I don't see the big picture.,"00:38:17,960","00:38:21,203"
640,I have a little picture.,"00:38:17,960","00:38:21,203"
641,"I take it out and look at it,","00:38:22,400","00:38:24,004"
642,every day.,"00:38:24,880","00:38:25,961"
643,You lost your parents in the bombings.,"00:38:26,120","00:38:28,930"
644,I've seen the records.,"00:38:26,120","00:38:28,930"
645,The records are not the picture.,"00:38:29,040","00:38:30,201"
646,Pietro.,"00:38:30,320","00:38:32,721"
647,"No, please.","00:38:30,320","00:38:32,721"
648,We were 10 years old.,"00:38:35,800","00:38:38,963"
649,"Having dinner, the four of us.","00:38:35,800","00:38:38,963"
650,"When the first shell hits, two floors below,","00:38:40,560","00:38:42,403"
651,it makes a hole in the floor.,"00:38:42,560","00:38:44,562"
652,It's big.,"00:38:44,720","00:38:46,245"
653,Our parents go in,"00:38:47,640","00:38:49,449"
654,and the whole building starts coming apart.,"00:38:49,560","00:38:52,643"
655,"I grab her,","00:38:53,360","00:38:54,885"
656,"roll under the bed, and the second shell hits.","00:38:55,560","00:38:57,688"
657,But it doesn't go off.,"00:38:58,040","00:38:59,963"
658,It just,"00:39:02,000","00:39:03,650"
659,sits there in the rubble.,"00:39:04,160","00:39:06,083"
660,Three feet from our faces.,"00:39:07,080","00:39:09,367"
661,And on the side of the shell is painted one word.,"00:39:10,440","00:39:13,925"
662,Stark.,"00:39:14,120","00:39:15,770"
663,We were trapped for two days.,"00:39:17,600","00:39:19,728"
664,"Every effort to save us,","00:39:20,200","00:39:22,009"
665,"every shift in the bricks,","00:39:22,120","00:39:23,690"
666,"I think, This will set it off.","00:39:23,880","00:39:26,167"
667,We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.,"00:39:29,440","00:39:33,287"
668,I know what they are.,"00:39:35,800","00:39:37,643"
669,I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.,"00:39:38,800","00:39:42,566"
670,Now I don't.,"00:39:43,560","00:39:44,721"
671,We will make it right.,"00:39:45,120","00:39:46,849"
672,You and I can hurt them.,"00:39:47,320","00:39:48,810"
673,But you will tear them apart,"00:39:50,280","00:39:53,568"
674,from the inside.,"00:39:55,560","00:39:57,403"
675,He's all over the globe.,"00:40:04,000","00:40:05,206"
676,"Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs.","00:40:05,320","00:40:08,529"
677,"Reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.","00:40:08,640","00:40:12,729"
678,Fatalities?,"00:40:12,840","00:40:14,001"
679,Only when engaged.,"00:40:14,120","00:40:15,201"
680,Mostly guys left in a fugue state,"00:40:15,320","00:40:16,970"
681,"going on about old memories, worst fears,","00:40:17,080","00:40:19,321"
682,and something too fast to see.,"00:40:19,520","00:40:21,682"
683,Maximoffs.,"00:40:21,800","00:40:23,211"
684,That makes sense he'd go to them.,"00:40:23,480","00:40:26,165"
685,They have someone in common.,"00:40:23,480","00:40:26,165"
686,Not any more.,"00:40:26,280","00:40:28,203"
687,That's a negative. I answer to you.,"00:40:32,080","00:40:34,003"
688,"Yes, ma'am.","00:40:35,360","00:40:36,407"
689,Barton. Might have something.,"00:40:36,520","00:40:38,329"
690,I gotta go.,"00:40:38,840","00:40:39,887"
691,Who was that?,"00:40:40,040","00:40:41,201"
692,Girlfriend.,"00:40:42,000","00:40:43,240"
693,What's this?,"00:40:46,000","00:40:47,126"
694,A message. Ultron killed Strucker.,"00:40:47,280","00:40:49,487"
695,"And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.","00:40:51,000","00:40:53,731"
696,This is a smoke screen.,"00:40:53,880","00:40:55,291"
697,Why send a message when you've just given a speech?,"00:40:55,400","00:40:57,801"
698,Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.,"00:40:57,920","00:41:00,287"
699,"Yeah, I bet he... Yeah.","00:41:00,400","00:41:02,209"
700,Everything we had on Strucker's been erased.,"00:41:02,880","00:41:04,600"
701,Not everything.,"00:41:04,960","00:41:06,200"
702,Known associates.,"00:41:07,840","00:41:09,490"
703,Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.,"00:41:10,000","00:41:11,570"
704,"Well, these people are all horrible.","00:41:11,720","00:41:13,160"
705,Wait. I know that guy.,"00:41:13,440","00:41:15,169"
706,From back in the day.,"00:41:17,640","00:41:19,210"

711,I didn't sell him anything.,"00:41:23,560","00:41:24,891"
712,"He was talking about finding something new, a gamechanger.","00:41:25,760","00:41:27,762"
713,It was all very Ahab.,"00:41:27,920","00:41:29,251"
714,This?,"00:41:30,040","00:41:31,166"
715,"It's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.","00:41:31,320","00:41:32,321"
716,"Those are tattoos, this is a brand.","00:41:32,440","00:41:34,807"
717,Yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief.,"00:41:36,480","00:41:39,962"
718,In a much less friendly way.,"00:41:40,560","00:41:41,925"
719,What dialect?,"00:41:42,200","00:41:43,964"

722,If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...,"00:41:47,400","00:41:49,920"
723,I thought your father said he got the last of it.,"00:41:50,000","00:41:51,161"
724,I don't follow.,"00:41:51,240","00:41:54,170"

726,The strongest metal on Earth.,"00:41:56,000","00:41:57,923"
727,Where is this guy now?,"00:41:59,280","00:42:00,611"
728,Don't tell me your men swindled you.,"00:42:26,000","00:42:27,809"
729,I sent you six shortrange heatseekers and got a boat full of rusted parts.,"00:42:27,960","00:42:33,086"
730,"Now, you will make it right,","00:42:33,200","00:42:34,486"
731,or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.,"00:42:34,640","00:42:37,803"
732,"Now, minister, where were we?","00:42:39,720","00:42:42,166"

735,Do you want a candy?,"00:43:22,200","00:43:23,850"
736,I was sorry to hear about Strucker.,"00:43:25,360","00:43:27,931"
737,"But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create.","00:43:28,080","00:43:31,084"
738,Human life. Not a growth market.,"00:43:31,680","00:43:34,081"
739,You didn't know?,"00:43:36,800","00:43:38,450"
740,Is this your first time intimidating someone?,"00:43:38,880","00:43:42,362"
741,I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.,"00:43:42,680","00:43:45,206"
742,Everybody is afraid of something.,"00:43:45,360","00:43:47,681"
743,Cuttlefish.,"00:43:47,800","00:43:48,801"

746,"...to hypnotise their prey, and then...","00:43:54,880","00:43:56,723"
747,I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.,"00:43:58,000","00:44:00,128"
748,So if you're going to fiddle with my brain,"00:44:05,600","00:44:08,171"
749,"and make me see a giant cuttlefish,","00:44:09,120","00:44:11,327"
750,then I know you don't do business.,"00:44:11,600","00:44:13,682"
751,And I know you're not in charge.,"00:44:13,800","00:44:16,121"
752,And I only deal,"00:44:16,320","00:44:17,606"
753,with the man in charge.,"00:44:18,680","00:44:20,330"

759,it came at great personal cost.,"00:44:54,280","00:44:57,284"
760,It's worth billions.,"00:44:57,680","00:44:59,284"
761,Now so are you.,"00:45:03,600","00:45:04,681"

1059,You still think you're the only monster on the team?,"01:08:25,760","01:08:28,843"
1060,"So, we disappear?","01:08:35,040","01:08:37,122"
1061,Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?,"01:08:43,800","01:08:45,640"
1062,Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.,"01:08:46,480","01:08:49,006"

1068,Seems like you walked away all right.,"01:09:02,280","01:09:03,760"
1069,Is that a problem?,"01:09:06,200","01:09:07,201"
1070,I don't trust a guy without a dark side.,"01:09:07,560","01:09:09,483"
1071,Call me oldfashioned.,"01:09:10,680","01:09:11,727"
1072,"Well, let's just say you haven't seen it yet.","01:09:11,840","01:09:14,411"
1073,"You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?","01:09:14,720","01:09:16,927"
1074,"Well, I guess you'd know.","01:09:17,160","01:09:19,401"
1075,Whether you'd tell us is a bit of a question.,"01:09:19,520","01:09:20,806"
1076,Banner and I were doing research.,"01:09:20,960","01:09:22,086"
1077,That would affect the team.,"01:09:22,240","01:09:24,440"
1078,That would end the team!,"01:09:22,240","01:09:24,440"
1079,Isn't that the mission?,"01:09:24,680","01:09:25,761"
1080,Isn't that the Why We Fight?,"01:09:25,960","01:09:27,200"
1081,So we can end the fight.,"01:09:27,320","01:09:29,561"

1087,"Clint said you wouldn't mind,","01:09:43,720","01:09:44,880"
1088,but our tractor doesn't seem to want to start at all.,"01:09:44,920","01:09:47,446"
1089,I thought maybe you might...,"01:09:47,760","01:09:50,120"

1096,Try not to bring it to life.,"01:10:16,920","01:10:18,809"
1097,"Why, Ms Barton, you little minx.","01:10:18,960","01:10:20,485"
1098,"I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?","01:10:20,840","01:10:23,366"

1101,You never even hesitated.,"01:10:27,400","01:10:29,050"
1102,"Look, it's been a really long day,","01:10:29,360","01:10:30,720"
1103,"like Eugene O'Neill long,","01:10:30,800","01:10:32,404"

1107,I'm not the director of anybody.,"01:10:39,160","01:10:41,003"
1108,I'm just an old man,"01:10:41,320","01:10:42,924"
1109,who cares very much about you.,"01:10:43,600","01:10:45,170"
1110,And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.,"01:10:48,040","01:10:49,849"
1111,I saw it.,"01:10:51,680","01:10:52,806"
1112,I didn't tell the team. How could I?,"01:10:53,000","01:10:54,570"
1113,"I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.","01:10:55,840","01:10:57,683"
1114,"The whole world, too.","01:10:58,040","01:10:59,565"
1115,Because of me.,"01:11:00,000","01:11:01,001"

1122,The end of the path I started us on.,"01:11:16,520","01:11:18,682"
1123,"You come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony.","01:11:19,560","01:11:21,800"
1124,War isn't one of them.,"01:11:23,960","01:11:25,371"
1125,I watched my friends die.,"01:11:28,960","01:11:30,405"

1127,Nope.,"01:11:34,120","01:11:35,565"
1128,It wasn't the worst part.,"01:11:36,560","01:11:39,086"
1129,The worst part,"01:11:36,560","01:11:39,086"
1130,is that you didn't.,"01:11:40,120","01:11:41,406"
1131,I'll see you tonight.,"01:11:48,120","01:11:49,201"

1136,It's dangerous.,"01:11:59,960","01:12:01,325"
1137,I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.,"01:12:01,960","01:12:03,689"
1138,Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time.,"01:12:06,600","01:12:09,922"
1139,My contacts all say he's building something.,"01:12:10,280","01:12:13,250"
1140,"The amount of vibranium he made off with,","01:12:13,360","01:12:15,966"
1141,I don't think it's just one thing.,"01:12:16,080","01:12:17,570"
1142,What about Ultron himself?,"01:12:17,680","01:12:19,011"
1143,He's easy to track. He's everywhere.,"01:12:19,120","01:12:21,487"
1144,The guy is multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.,"01:12:21,920","01:12:24,287"
1145,"It still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans, though.","01:12:24,960","01:12:27,770"
1146,Is he still going after launch codes?,"01:12:28,000","01:12:29,081"
1147,"Yes, he is.","01:12:29,360","01:12:30,725"
1148,But he's not making any headway.,"01:12:30,840","01:12:32,330"
1149,I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.,"01:12:32,440","01:12:34,522"
1150,"Well, I contacted our friends at the Nexus about that.","01:12:34,640","01:12:37,246"
1151,Nexus?,"01:12:37,320","01:12:38,321"
1152,It's the world Internet hub in Oslo.,"01:12:38,440","01:12:40,090"
1153,Every byte of data flows through there.,"01:12:40,520","01:12:42,284"

1155,"So, what did they say?","01:12:43,720","01:12:44,767"
1156,He's fixated on the missiles.,"01:12:45,000","01:12:46,764"
1157,But the codes are constantly being changed.,"01:12:47,000","01:12:48,680"
1158,By whom?,"01:12:49,160","01:12:50,161"
1159,Parties unknown.,"01:12:51,400","01:12:52,606"

1161,Ultron's got an enemy.,"01:12:54,040","01:12:56,361"
1162,That's not the same thing.,"01:12:54,040","01:12:56,361"
1163,"Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.","01:12:56,720","01:12:58,563"
1164,I might need to visit Oslo.,"01:12:58,680","01:12:59,841"
1165,Find our unknown.,"01:13:00,320","01:13:01,481"
1166,"Well, this is good times, boss,","01:13:01,640","01:13:03,085"
1167,"but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,","01:13:03,200","01:13:04,486"
1168,you'd have more than that.,"01:13:04,600","01:13:05,640"
1169,I do. I have you.,"01:13:05,880","01:13:07,882"
1170,"Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.","01:13:08,760","01:13:11,966"
1171,"Ears, everywhere else.","01:13:08,760","01:13:11,966"
1172,You kids had all the tech you could dream up.,"01:13:12,320","01:13:15,324"
1173,"Here we all are, back on Earth,","01:13:16,320","01:13:18,322"
1174,with nothing but our wit and our will to save the world.,"01:13:18,560","01:13:22,050"
1175,Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing,"01:13:23,640","01:13:25,802"
1176,between him and his mission.,"01:13:26,000","01:13:27,445"
1177,"And whether or not he admits it,","01:13:27,560","01:13:29,722"
1178,his mission is global destruction.,"01:13:29,880","01:13:32,611"
1179,"All this, laid in a grave.","01:13:33,840","01:13:36,002"

1379,between saving the world and destroying it.,"01:27:00,800","01:27:03,121"
1380,Where do you think he gets that?,"01:27:05,040","01:27:07,486"
1381,Anything on Nat?,"01:27:09,680","01:27:11,250"
1382,I haven't heard.,"01:27:09,680","01:27:11,250"
1383,"But she's alive, or Ultron would be rubbing our faces in it.","01:27:11,360","01:27:13,727"
1384,This is sealed tight.,"01:27:13,840","01:27:15,171"
1385,"We're gonna need to access the program,","01:27:15,320","01:27:16,840"
1386,break it down from within.,"01:27:16,880","01:27:18,803"
1387,Any chance Natasha might leave you a message outside the Internet?,"01:27:20,040","01:27:22,766"
1388,Oldschool spy stuff?,"01:27:22,880","01:27:23,927"
1389,There are some nets I can cast.,"01:27:24,400","01:27:26,209"
1390,"Yeah, I'll find her.","01:27:26,320","01:27:27,560"
1391,I can work on tissue degeneration,"01:27:30,160","01:27:31,924"
1392,if you could fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.,"01:27:32,040","01:27:35,249"
1393,"Yeah, about that.","01:27:35,400","01:27:36,526"
1394,No.,"01:27:40,960","01:27:41,961"
1395,You have to trust me.,"01:27:42,160","01:27:44,003"
1396,Kind of don't.,"01:27:42,160","01:27:44,003"
1397,"Our ally, the guy protecting the military's nuclear codes,","01:27:44,160","01:27:48,210"
1398,I found him.,"01:27:50,160","01:27:51,161"
1399,"Hello, Dr Banner.","01:27:51,240","01:27:52,366"
1400,Ultron didn't go after Jarvis because he was angry.,"01:27:53,240","01:27:55,481"
1401,He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do.,"01:27:56,080","01:27:59,687"
1402,So Jarvis went underground.,"01:28:00,840","01:28:02,490"
1403,"Scattered, dumped his memory.","01:28:02,600","01:28:04,090"
1404,But not his protocols.,"01:28:04,680","01:28:06,170"
1405,He didn't even know he was in there until I pieced him together.,"01:28:06,600","01:28:10,047"
1406,"So, you want me to help you put Jarvis into this thing?","01:28:12,880","01:28:17,681"
1407,No! Of course not.,"01:28:17,800","01:28:19,564"
1408,I wanna help you put Jarvis in this thing.,"01:28:19,720","01:28:21,404"
1409,"We're out of my field, here.","01:28:23,800","01:28:25,450"
1410,You know bioorganics better than anyone.,"01:28:25,560","01:28:27,562"
1411,And you just assume that Jarvis's operational matrix,"01:28:27,880","01:28:30,770"
1412,can beat Ultron's?,"01:28:30,880","01:28:32,325"
1413,Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it.,"01:28:32,440","01:28:35,728"
1414,This is the opportunity.,"01:28:35,880","01:28:36,881"
1415,We can create Ultron's perfect self,"01:28:36,960","01:28:38,724"
1416,without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality.,"01:28:38,880","01:28:42,362"
1417,We have to.,"01:28:42,480","01:28:44,562"
1418,I believe it's worth a go.,"01:28:42,480","01:28:44,562"
1419,I'm in a loop!,"01:28:47,160","01:28:48,241"
1420,I'm caught in a time loop.,"01:28:48,400","01:28:51,370"
1421,This is exactly where it all went wrong.,"01:28:48,400","01:28:51,370"
1422,I know. I know. I know what everyone's gonna say.,"01:28:51,480","01:28:53,400"
1423,But they're already saying it.,"01:28:53,480","01:28:55,448"
1424,We're mad scientists.,"01:28:56,000","01:28:57,161"
1425,"We're monsters, buddy.","01:28:57,920","01:29:00,651"
1426,We've gotta own it.,"01:28:57,920","01:29:00,651"
1427,Make a stand.,"01:29:01,640","01:29:02,880"
1428,It's not a loop.,"01:29:08,280","01:29:09,770"
1429,It's the end of the line.,"01:29:11,000","01:29:12,764"
1430,I wasn't sure you would wake up.,"01:29:33,280","01:29:35,408"
1431,I hoped you would.,"01:29:35,520","01:29:38,967"
1432,I wanted to show you.,"01:29:35,520","01:29:38,967"
1433,I don't have anyone else.,"01:29:39,120","01:29:40,804"
1434,I think a lot about meteors.,"01:29:43,640","01:29:47,247"
1435,The purity in them.,"01:29:43,640","01:29:47,247"
1436,Boom! The end.,"01:29:47,400","01:29:48,925"
1437,Start again.,"01:29:49,400","01:29:50,811"
1438,The world made clean,"01:29:50,960","01:29:52,928"
1439,for the new man to rebuild.,"01:29:53,040","01:29:55,361"
1440,I was meant to be new.,"01:29:55,680","01:29:57,808"
1441,I was meant to be beautiful.,"01:29:58,680","01:30:01,286"
1442,The world would have looked to the sky,"01:30:01,840","01:30:03,968"
1443,"and seen hope,","01:30:04,080","01:30:05,320"
1444,seen mercy.,"01:30:05,680","01:30:07,011"
1445,"Instead, they'll look up in horror","01:30:07,800","01:30:09,882"
1446,because of you.,"01:30:10,000","01:30:11,331"
1447,You've wounded me.,"01:30:11,520","01:30:13,329"
1448,I give you full marks for that.,"01:30:14,000","01:30:15,684"
1449,"But, like the man said, what doesn't kill me...","01:30:16,320","01:30:19,244"
1450,...just makes me stronger.,"01:30:24,480","01:30:25,811"
1451,This framework is not compatible.,"01:31:05,880","01:31:08,042"
1452,The genetic coding tower is at 97%.,"01:31:08,200","01:31:10,885"
1453,You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.,"01:31:11,000","01:31:14,846"
1454,I'm gonna say this once.,"01:31:17,120","01:31:19,043"
1455,How about nonece?,"01:31:17,120","01:31:19,043"
1456,Shut it down!,"01:31:19,240","01:31:21,288"
1457,"Nope, not gonna happen.","01:31:19,240","01:31:21,288"
1458,You don't know what you're doing.,"01:31:21,400","01:31:22,561"
1459,And you do?,"01:31:22,720","01:31:24,051"
1460,She's not in your head?,"01:31:24,400","01:31:25,401"
1461,I know you're angry.,"01:31:25,560","01:31:27,210"
1462,We're way past that.,"01:31:27,320","01:31:28,685"
1463,I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.,"01:31:28,800","01:31:31,246"
1464,"Banner, after everything that's happened...","01:31:31,480","01:31:33,160"
1465,It's nothing compared to what's coming!,"01:31:33,240","01:31:34,605"
1466,You don't know what's in there.,"01:31:34,720","01:31:37,087"
1467,This isn't a game!,"01:31:34,720","01:31:37,087"
1468,"No, no. Go on.","01:31:40,400","01:31:41,811"
1469,You were saying?,"01:31:42,760","01:31:44,683"
1470,Pietro!,"01:31:50,920","01:31:51,967"
1471,What?,"01:31:52,520","01:31:53,601"
1472,You didn't see that coming?,"01:31:54,000","01:31:55,570"
1473,I'm rerouting the upload.,"01:31:57,760","01:31:58,921"
1474,"Go ahead, piss me off.","01:32:05,240","01:32:07,004"
1475,Wait!,"01:32:19,320","01:32:20,446"
1476,I am sorry. That was,"01:33:45,120","01:33:47,361"
1477,odd.,"01:33:48,360","01:33:49,771"
1478,Thank you.,"01:33:50,000","01:33:51,240"
1479,Thor.,"01:33:56,160","01:33:57,207"
1480,You helped create this?,"01:33:58,720","01:34:01,326"
1481,I've had a vision.,"01:33:58,720","01:34:01,326"
1482,"A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life, and at its centre is that.","01:34:01,560","01:34:05,281"
1483,What? The gem?,"01:34:06,240","01:34:07,241"
1484,It's the Mind Stone.,"01:34:07,400","01:34:09,971"
1485,It's one of the six Infinity Stones.,"01:34:07,400","01:34:09,971"
1486,"The greatest power in the universe,","01:34:10,120","01:34:11,360"
1487,unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.,"01:34:11,480","01:34:13,642"
1488,Then why would you bring...,"01:34:13,760","01:34:15,728"
1489,Because Stark is right.,"01:34:13,760","01:34:15,728"
1490,It's definitely the end times.,"01:34:15,920","01:34:18,366"
1491,The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.,"01:34:18,560","01:34:19,721"
1492,Not alone.,"01:34:19,880","01:34:21,120"
1493,Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?,"01:34:21,520","01:34:23,443"
1494,We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix,"01:34:23,560","01:34:26,245"
1495,to create something new.,"01:34:26,760","01:34:28,524"
1496,I think I've had my fill of new.,"01:34:28,760","01:34:30,444"
1497,You think I'm a child of Ultron.,"01:34:30,600","01:34:32,887"
1498,You're not?,"01:34:33,240","01:34:34,526"
1499,I'm not Ultron.,"01:34:35,680","01:34:37,250"
1500,I am not Jarvis. I am...,"01:34:37,880","01:34:40,087"
1501,I am.,"01:34:42,200","01:34:43,611"
1502,I looked in your head,"01:34:45,520","01:34:46,646"
1503,and saw annihilation.,"01:34:47,360","01:34:49,124"
1504,Look again.,"01:34:49,280","01:34:50,645"
1505,Her seal of approval means jack to me.,"01:34:50,760","01:34:52,280"
1506,"Their powers, the horrors in our heads,","01:34:52,760","01:34:54,762"
1507,"Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone.","01:34:54,920","01:34:56,968"
1508,And they're nothing compared to what it can unleash.,"01:34:57,120","01:34:59,282"
1509,But with it on our side...,"01:34:59,440","01:35:00,965"
1510,Is it?,"01:34:59,440","01:35:00,965"
1511,Are you?,"01:35:02,400","01:35:03,561"
1512,On our side?,"01:35:04,440","01:35:05,885"
1513,I don't think it's that simple.,"01:35:07,760","01:35:09,649"
1514,"Well, it better get real simple real soon.","01:35:09,800","01:35:12,246"
1515,I am on the side of life.,"01:35:13,400","01:35:15,528"
1516,Ultron isn't.,"01:35:15,760","01:35:17,125"
1517,He will end it all.,"01:35:17,720","01:35:19,131"
1518,What's he waiting for?,"01:35:19,280","01:35:21,203"
1519,You.,"01:35:21,360","01:35:22,361"
1520,Where?,"01:35:21,360","01:35:22,361"
1521,Sokovia.,"01:35:22,800","01:35:23,961"
1522,"He's got Nat there, too.","01:35:24,080","01:35:25,161"
1523,"If we're wrong about you,","01:35:27,320","01:35:28,970"
1524,if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...,"01:35:31,640","01:35:33,640"
1525,What will you do?,"01:35:34,160","01:35:35,685"
1526,I don't want to kill Ultron.,"01:35:42,320","01:35:44,402"
1527,He's unique and he's in pain.,"01:35:44,800","01:35:48,122"
1528,But that pain will roll over the Earth.,"01:35:49,680","01:35:52,251"
1529,"So, he must be destroyed.","01:35:52,800","01:35:55,087"
1530,"Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net.","01:35:55,320","01:35:58,244"
1531,We have to act now.,"01:35:58,520","01:36:00,170"
1532,And not one of us can do it without the others.,"01:36:00,600","01:36:04,525"
1533,Maybe I am a monster.,"01:36:06,520","01:36:08,443"
1534,I don't think I'd know if I were one.,"01:36:08,600","01:36:10,841"
1535,"I'm not what you are,","01:36:12,000","01:36:13,604"
1536,and not what you intended.,"01:36:14,280","01:36:16,442"
1537,"So, there may be no way to make you trust me.","01:36:17,200","01:36:19,680"
1538,But we need to go.,"01:36:19,960","01:36:21,371"
1539,Right.,"01:36:36,160","01:36:37,321"
1540,Well done.,"01:36:37,960","01:36:39,200"
1541,Three minutes.,"01:36:40,960","01:36:42,007"
1542,Get what you need.,"01:36:42,720","01:36:44,370"
1543,"Good evening, boss.","01:37:00,200","01:37:01,247"
1544,No way we all get through this.,"01:37:06,400","01:37:08,084"
1545,"If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost.","01:37:08,200","01:37:10,280"
1546,There's gonna be blood on the floor.,"01:37:11,000","01:37:12,440"
1547,I got no plans tomorrow night.,"01:37:12,480","01:37:13,891"
1548,I get first crack at the big guy.,"01:37:14,000","01:37:15,320"
1549,Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.,"01:37:15,760","01:37:17,250"
1550,That's true. He hates you the most.,"01:37:17,360","01:37:19,761"
1551,Ultron knows we're coming.,"01:37:25,080","01:37:27,242"
1552,Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.,"01:37:27,520","01:37:29,727"
1553,And that's what we signed up for.,"01:37:30,240","01:37:31,969"
1554,"But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.","01:37:32,240","01:37:34,766"
1555,So our priority,"01:37:35,880","01:37:37,370"
1556,is getting them out.,"01:37:38,080","01:37:39,161"
1557,We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!,"01:37:39,400","01:37:42,324"
1558,Get off your asses.,"01:37:50,120","01:37:51,565"
1559,All they want is to live their lives in peace.,"01:37:52,800","01:37:54,723"
1560,And that's not gonna happen today.,"01:37:55,280","01:37:56,640"
1561,But we can do our best to protect them.,"01:37:58,280","01:38:00,009"
1562,And we can get the job done.,"01:38:00,720","01:38:02,245"
1563,"We find out what Ultron's been building,","01:38:05,640","01:38:07,927"
1564,"we find Romanoff,","01:38:08,880","01:38:10,484"
1565,and we clear the field.,"01:38:10,960","01:38:12,803"
1566,Keep the fight between us.,"01:38:14,240","01:38:16,163"
1567,Ultron thinks we're monsters.,"01:38:22,880","01:38:25,281"
1568,That we're what's wrong with the world.,"01:38:25,800","01:38:28,201"
1569,This isn't just about beating him.,"01:38:28,320","01:38:30,641"
1570,It's about whether he's right.,"01:38:31,160","01:38:33,208"
1571,Natasha!,"01:38:39,680","01:38:40,727"

1573,Bruce?,"01:38:43,000","01:38:44,081"
1574,You all right?,"01:38:45,520","01:38:46,521"
1575,Yeah.,"01:38:46,680","01:38:47,727"
1576,The team is in the city.,"01:38:47,840","01:38:49,569"
1577,It's about to light up.,"01:38:47,840","01:38:49,569"
1578,I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere.,"01:38:49,680","01:38:51,840"
1579,Yeah. I did.,"01:38:52,160","01:38:54,288"
1580,So what's our play?,"01:39:00,680","01:39:01,841"
1581,I'm here to get you to safety.,"01:39:02,040","01:39:03,405"
1582,Job's not finished.,"01:39:04,160","01:39:06,686"
1583,"We could help with the evacuation,","01:39:04,160","01:39:06,686"
1584,but I can't be in a fight near civilians.,"01:39:06,840","01:39:08,683"
1585,And you've done plenty.,"01:39:10,040","01:39:11,201"
1586,Our fight is over.,"01:39:13,600","01:39:15,090"
1587,"So, we just disappear?","01:39:16,480","01:39:18,721"
1588,Come on.,"01:39:22,880","01:39:24,723"
1589,"Your man's in the church, boss.","01:39:29,520","01:39:31,761"
1590,I think he's waiting for you.,"01:39:31,880","01:39:33,723"
1591,Come to confess your sins?,"01:39:37,800","01:39:39,848"
1592,I don't know. How much time you got?,"01:39:39,960","01:39:41,200"
1593,More than you.,"01:39:41,360","01:39:42,850"
1594,Have you been juicing?,"01:39:45,240","01:39:48,050"
1595,Little vibranium cocktail?,"01:39:45,240","01:39:48,050"
1596,You're looking...,"01:39:48,160","01:39:50,447"
1597,I don't wanna say puffy.,"01:39:48,160","01:39:50,447"
1598,You're stalling to protect the people.,"01:39:50,560","01:39:52,289"
1599,"Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?","01:39:52,680","01:39:55,524"
1600,I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free.,"01:39:55,840","01:39:58,320"
1601,What?,"01:40:03,080","01:40:04,127"
1602,You think you were the only one stalling?,"01:40:05,040","01:40:07,361"
1603,There's the rest of the vibranium.,"01:40:08,080","01:40:09,730"
1604,"Function, still unclear.","01:40:09,840","01:40:11,251"
1605,"This is how you end, Tony.","01:40:11,440","01:40:12,601"
1606,This is peace in my time.,"01:40:13,880","01:40:15,644"
1607,Go!,"01:40:32,360","01:40:33,407"
1608,Get off the bridge!,"01:40:38,960","01:40:40,291"

1612,They really did take everything from me.,"01:40:56,200","01:40:58,487"
1613,You set the terms.,"01:40:58,640","01:41:00,688"
1614,You can change them.,"01:40:58,640","01:41:00,688"
1615,All right.,"01:41:00,800","01:41:02,040"
1616,"Friday, the Vision?","01:41:26,240","01:41:27,480"
1617,"Boss, it's working.","01:41:27,640","01:41:29,800"
1618,He's burning Ultron out of the net.,"01:41:27,640","01:41:29,800"
1619,He won't escape through there.,"01:41:29,840","01:41:31,040"
1620,You shut me out.,"01:41:36,120","01:41:37,451"
1621,You think I care?,"01:41:37,920","01:41:39,126"
1622,"You take away my world,","01:41:41,120","01:41:42,326"
1623,I take away yours.,"01:41:43,200","01:41:44,929"

1625,Sokovia is going for a ride.,"01:42:30,800","01:42:33,246"
1626,Do you see,"01:42:45,760","01:42:47,250"
1627,the beauty of it?,"01:42:47,720","01:42:49,245"
1628,The inevitability.,"01:42:49,840","01:42:51,683"
1629,"You rise, only to fall.","01:42:51,920","01:42:55,163"
1630,"You, Avengers, you are my meteor.","01:42:57,920","01:43:00,764"
1631,My swift and terrible sword.,"01:43:01,680","01:43:03,409"
1632,And the earth will crack,"01:43:03,600","01:43:05,090"
1633,with the weight of your failure.,"01:43:05,280","01:43:07,203"
1634,"Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me.","01:43:08,880","01:43:12,646"
1635,It means nothing.,"01:43:13,120","01:43:14,531"
1636,"When the dust settles,","01:43:15,600","01:43:16,965"
1637,the only thing living in this world,"01:43:17,120","01:43:19,009"
1638,will be metal.,"01:43:19,520","01:43:20,521"
1639,We gotta move.,"01:43:25,080","01:43:26,650"
1640,You're not gonna turn green?,"01:43:26,960","01:43:28,080"
1641,I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.,"01:43:28,280","01:43:30,200"
1642,I adore you.,"01:43:31,360","01:43:32,646"
1643,But I need the other guy.,"01:43:41,280","01:43:43,203"
1644,Let's finish the job.,"01:43:48,040","01:43:49,804"
1645,I really hope this makes us even.,"01:44:06,600","01:44:08,011"
1646,Now go be a hero.,"01:44:10,320","01:44:12,368"
1647,The vibranium core's got a magnetic field.,"01:44:20,840","01:44:22,763"
1648,That's what's keeping the rock together.,"01:44:22,920","01:44:24,922"
1649,If it drops?,"01:44:25,040","01:44:26,087"
1650,"Right now, the impact will kill thousands.","01:44:26,160","01:44:27,491"
1651,Once it gets high enough?,"01:44:27,560","01:44:30,291"
1652,Global extinction.,"01:44:27,560","01:44:30,291"
1653,That building's not clear. The 10th floor.,"01:44:34,600","01:44:36,682"
1654,Hi.,"01:44:41,560","01:44:42,561"
1655,Okay. Get in the tub!,"01:44:43,680","01:44:46,047"
1656,"I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.","01:44:52,880","01:44:54,723"
1657,"Cap, you got incoming.","01:44:57,520","01:44:58,726"
1658,Incoming already came in.,"01:44:58,880","01:45:00,530"
1659,"Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely.","01:45:03,200","01:45:05,680"
1660,"The rest of us have one job,","01:45:06,400","01:45:08,209"
1661,tear these things apart.,"01:45:08,360","01:45:09,521"
1662,"You get hurt, hurt them back.","01:45:09,840","01:45:11,444"
1663,"You get killed,","01:45:12,120","01:45:13,281"
1664,walk it off.,"01:45:14,320","01:45:15,606"
1665,"Go, go, go!","01:45:50,040","01:45:51,246"
1666,How could I let this happen?,"01:45:56,920","01:45:58,684"
1667,"Hey, hey, you okay?","01:45:58,800","01:46:00,848"
1668,This is all our fault.,"01:45:58,800","01:46:00,848"
1669,"Hey, look at me.","01:46:01,040","01:46:03,240"
1670,"It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.","01:46:01,040","01:46:03,240"
1671,Who cares?,"01:46:03,280","01:46:04,327"
1672,Are you up for this?,"01:46:04,440","01:46:05,965"
1673,Are you?,"01:46:06,080","01:46:07,161"
1674,"Look, I just need to know.","01:46:07,400","01:46:10,807"
1675,Because the city is flying.,"01:46:07,400","01:46:10,807"
1676,"Okay. Look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots,","01:46:11,120","01:46:15,003"
1677,and I have a bow and arrow.,"01:46:15,920","01:46:17,126"
1678,None of this makes sense.,"01:46:17,280","01:46:18,361"
1679,But I'm going back out there because it's my job.,"01:46:21,640","01:46:23,768"
1680,Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.,"01:46:24,640","01:46:27,291"
1681,It doesn't matter what you did or what you were.,"01:46:27,440","01:46:30,444"
1682,"If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill.","01:46:30,640","01:46:33,246"
1683,"Stay in here, you're good.","01:46:34,280","01:46:36,920"
1684,I'll send your brother to come find you.,"01:46:34,280","01:46:36,920"
1685,"But if you step out that door,","01:46:36,960","01:46:38,803"
1686,you are an Avenger.,"01:46:39,720","01:46:40,721"
1687,All right. Good chat.,"01:46:45,600","01:46:47,409"
1688,"Yeah, the city is flying.","01:46:51,160","01:46:52,207"
1689,I got you!,"01:47:26,200","01:47:27,361"
1690,Just look at me!,"01:47:27,680","01:47:28,920"
1691,You can't save them all.,"01:47:35,680","01:47:37,011"
1692,You'll never...,"01:47:38,360","01:47:39,407"
1693,Never what? You didn't finish!,"01:47:40,680","01:47:43,126"
1694,"What, were you napping?","01:47:46,880","01:47:48,450"
1695,Thor.,"01:48:09,920","01:48:11,001"
1696,You're bothering me.,"01:48:13,600","01:48:15,204"
1697,"All right, we're all clear here.","01:48:50,600","01:48:51,880"
1698,We are not clear!,"01:48:51,960","01:48:53,007"
1699,We are very not clear!,"01:48:53,120","01:48:54,531"
1700,"All right, coming to you.","01:48:57,600","01:48:58,931"
1701,"Keep up, old man!","01:48:59,400","01:49:01,482"
1702,Nobody would know.,"01:49:03,240","01:49:04,765"
1703,Nobody.,"01:49:05,600","01:49:06,647"
1704,"The last I saw him, an Ultron was sitting on him.","01:49:08,600","01:49:11,524"
1705,"Yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard.","01:49:11,640","01:49:13,529"
1706,I miss him already.,"01:49:13,600","01:49:14,601"
1707,Hold your fire!,"01:49:30,160","01:49:31,321"
1708,Romanoff!,"01:49:41,200","01:49:42,247"
1709,Thanks!,"01:49:42,760","01:49:43,761"
1710,The antigravs are rigged to flip.,"01:49:53,160","01:49:54,764"
1711,"Touch them, they'll go full reverse thrust.","01:49:54,880","01:49:57,042"
1712,The city's not coming down slow.,"01:49:57,160","01:49:58,605"
1713,Spire is vibranium.,"01:49:58,720","01:49:59,846"
1714,If I get Thor to hit it...,"01:49:59,960","01:50:01,086"
1715,It will crack. That's not enough.,"01:50:01,360","01:50:02,725"
1716,The impact would still be devastating.,"01:50:02,840","01:50:04,365"
1717,Maybe if we can cap the other end.,"01:50:04,520","01:50:05,880"
1718,Keep the atomic action doubling back.,"01:50:06,040","01:50:07,690"
1719,That could vaporise the city.,"01:50:07,840","01:50:09,205"
1720,And everyone on it.,"01:50:10,200","01:50:12,043"
1721,The next wave is gonna hit any minute.,"01:50:17,880","01:50:19,723"
1722,"What do you got, Stark?","01:50:19,880","01:50:21,848"
1723,Nothing great.,"01:50:19,880","01:50:21,848"
1724,Maybe a way to blow up the city.,"01:50:22,640","01:50:24,881"
1725,"That'll keep it from impacting the surface,","01:50:25,000","01:50:26,286"
1726,if you guys can get clear.,"01:50:26,400","01:50:27,447"
1727,"I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.","01:50:27,720","01:50:29,609"
1728,Impact radius is getting bigger every second.,"01:50:29,840","01:50:32,730"
1729,We're gonna have to make a choice.,"01:50:32,920","01:50:34,285"
1730,"Cap, these people are going nowhere.","01:50:35,040","01:50:36,565"
1731,If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...,"01:50:37,400","01:50:40,200"
1732,Not till everyone's safe.,"01:50:37,400","01:50:40,200"
1733,Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.,"01:50:40,600","01:50:43,604"
1734,I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.,"01:50:43,840","01:50:45,800"
1735,I didn't say we should leave.,"01:50:45,840","01:50:47,285"
1736,There's worse ways to go.,"01:50:50,120","01:50:51,929"
1737,Where else am I gonna get a view like this?,"01:50:57,400","01:50:59,846"
1738,"Glad you like the view, Romanoff.","01:51:00,720","01:51:03,326"
1739,It's about to get better.,"01:51:03,440","01:51:05,044"
1740,"Nice, right?","01:51:29,160","01:51:30,366"
1741,Pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.,"01:51:30,480","01:51:32,926"
1742,"She's dusty, but she'll do.","01:51:33,080","01:51:34,730"
1743,"Fury, you son of a bitch.","01:51:35,080","01:51:36,525"
1744,Ooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?,"01:51:36,680","01:51:38,967"
1745,"Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.","01:51:39,080","01:51:41,287"
1746,Lifeboats secure to deploy.,"01:51:41,440","01:51:42,965"
1747,"Disengage in three, two...","01:51:43,080","01:51:45,765"
1748,Take them out.,"01:51:46,960","01:51:47,961"
1749,This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?,"01:51:57,640","01:51:59,165"
1750,This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.,"01:51:59,280","01:52:01,726"
1751,is supposed to be.,"01:51:59,280","01:52:01,726"
1752,This is not so bad.,"01:52:03,400","01:52:04,811"
1753,Let's load them up.,"01:52:08,080","01:52:09,411"
1754,"Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.","01:52:14,800","01:52:18,641"
1755,Show 'em what we got.,"01:52:19,000","01:52:20,206"
1756,You're up.,"01:52:20,560","01:52:21,561"
1757,Yes!,"01:52:26,840","01:52:27,841"
1758,Now this is gonna be a good story.,"01:52:28,080","01:52:29,844"
1759,Yup. If you live to tell it.,"01:52:32,480","01:52:34,562"
1760,You think I can't hold my own?,"01:52:34,720","01:52:36,722"
1761,"We get through this, I'll hold your own.","01:52:36,840","01:52:38,440"
1762,You had to make it weird.,"01:52:38,520","01:52:40,363"

1888,Of death.,"02:05:23,520","02:05:24,681"
1889,You're the last one.,"02:05:25,400","02:05:27,209"
1890,You were supposed to be the last.,"02:05:27,440","02:05:29,886"

1892,and settled for a slave.,"02:05:33,440","02:05:35,124"

1912,"But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.","02:07:47,360","02:07:50,730"
1913,Right.,"02:07:52,280","02:07:53,645"
1914,Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.,"02:07:54,080","02:07:56,321"

1929,"So, it doesn't count?","02:08:38,360","02:08:40,283"
1930,"No, it's not like a person lifting the hammer.","02:08:40,480","02:08:42,289"
1931,"Right, different rules for us.","02:08:42,560","02:08:44,210"

1934,"He can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone.","02:08:45,680","02:08:48,570"
1935,It's safe with the Vision.,"02:08:49,480","02:08:51,562"
1936,"And these days, safe is in short supply.","02:08:51,800","02:08:54,326"
1937,But if you put the hammer in an elevator...,"02:08:56,360","02:08:58,328"
1938,It would still go up.,"02:08:58,440","02:09:00,320"
