308,some fairly advanced robotics work.,"00:18:43,480","00:18:46,563"
309,"They deep-sixed the data,","00:18:47,680","00:18:50,251"

329,What if the world was safe?,"00:19:31,880","00:19:33,803"

336,to the Ultron program.,"00:19:42,440","00:19:44,120"

343,and you don't want to tell the team?,"00:19:53,120","00:19:54,560"
344,Right. That's right. You know why?,"00:19:55,600","00:19:57,011"

1230,One less thing to worry about.,"01:08:06,960","01:08:08,325"

1257,"Well, I guess you'd know.","01:09:17,160","01:09:19,401"

1305,I wasn't ready.,"01:11:02,240","01:11:03,685"
1306,I didn't do all I could.,"01:11:05,160","01:11:06,571"

1319,- It wasn't the worst part.,"01:11:36,560","01:11:39,086"
1320,- The worst part,"01:11:36,560","01:11:39,086"
1321,is that you didn't.,"01:11:40,120","01:11:41,406"

1329,I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.,"01:12:01,960","01:12:03,689"

1331,to buy himself time.,"01:12:06,600","01:12:09,922"

1338,He's easy to track. He's everywhere.,"01:12:19,120","01:12:21,487"

1340,than a Catholic rabbit.,"01:12:21,920","01:12:24,287"

1342,"on any of his plans, though.","01:12:24,960","01:12:27,770"
1343,Is he still going after launch codes?,"01:12:28,000","01:12:29,081"
1344,"Yes, he is.","01:12:29,360","01:12:30,725"
1345,But he's not making any headway.,"01:12:30,840","01:12:32,330"

1347,in high school on a dare.,"01:12:32,440","01:12:34,522"

1362,That's not the same thing.,"01:12:54,040","01:12:56,361"
1363,"Still, I'd pay folding money","01:12:56,720","01:12:58,563"
1364,to know who it is.,"01:12:56,720","01:12:58,563"

1627,"Hello, Dr Banner.","01:27:51,240","01:27:52,366"
1628,Ultron didn't go after Jarvis,"01:27:53,240","01:27:55,481"
1629,because he was angry.,"01:27:53,240","01:27:55,481"

1631,scared of what he can do.,"01:27:56,080","01:27:59,687"

1633,"Scattered, dumped his memory.","01:28:02,600","01:28:04,090"

2201,Yes.,"02:06:00,880","02:06:01,927"
2202,But a thing isn't beautiful,"02:06:06,160","02:06:09,084"
2203,because it lasts.,"02:06:06,160","02:06:09,084"
2204,It's a privilege to be among them.,"02:06:11,160","02:06:13,162"
2205,You're unbearably naive.,"02:06:13,400","02:06:15,926"
2206,Well...,"02:06:16,200","02:06:17,406"
2207,I was born yesterday.,"02:06:19,480","02:06:21,528"
2208,Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!,"02:07:34,160","02:07:36,242"
2209,Fat.,"02:07:37,600","02:07:38,601"
2210,One of our tech boys flagged this.,"02:07:39,720","02:07:41,080"
2211,Splashed down in the Banda Sea.,"02:07:42,200","02:07:44,362"
2212,Could be the Quinjet.,"02:07:45,480","02:07:47,005"
2213,"But with Stark's stealth tech,","02:07:47,360","02:07:50,730"
2214,we still can't track the damn thing.,"02:07:47,360","02:07:50,730"
2215,Right.,"02:07:52,280","02:07:53,645"
2216,Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.,"02:07:54,080","02:07:56,321"
2217,He'll send a postcard.,"02:07:57,600","02:07:59,489"
2218,"""Wish you were here.""","02:07:59,760","02:08:01,489"
2219,You sent me to recruit him,"02:08:03,440","02:08:06,728"
2220,way back when.,"02:08:03,440","02:08:06,728"
2221,Did you know then,"02:08:08,560","02:08:11,131"
2222,what was gonna happen?,"02:08:08,560","02:08:11,131"
2223,You never know.,"02:08:13,320","02:08:15,243"
2224,"You hope for the best,","02:08:15,440","02:08:18,967"
2225,then make do with what you get.,"02:08:15,440","02:08:18,967"

2227,Nothing lasts forever.,"02:08:22,040","02:08:24,008"
2228,"Trouble, Ms Romanoff.","02:08:24,280","02:08:26,328"

2230,trouble still comes around.,"02:08:26,560","02:08:29,928"
2231,The rules have changed.,"02:08:33,800","02:08:35,006"
2232,We're dealing with something new.,"02:08:35,200","02:08:36,804"
2233,The Vision is artificial intelligence.,"02:08:36,960","02:08:38,246"
2234,- A machine.,"02:08:38,360","02:08:40,283"
2235,"- So, it doesn't count?","02:08:38,360","02:08:40,283"
2236,"No, it's not like","02:08:40,480","02:08:42,289"
2237,a person lifting the hammer.,"02:08:40,480","02:08:42,289"
2238,"Right, different rules for us.","02:08:42,560","02:08:44,210"
2239,- Nice guy. Artificial.,"02:08:44,440","02:08:45,487"
2240,- Thank you.,"02:08:44,440","02:08:45,487"
2241,"He can wield the hammer,","02:08:45,680","02:08:48,570"
2242,he can keep the Mind Stone.,"02:08:45,680","02:08:48,570"
2243,It's safe with the Vision.,"02:08:49,480","02:08:51,562"
2244,"And these days, safe is in short supply.","02:08:51,800","02:08:54,326"
2245,But if you put the hammer,"02:08:56,360","02:08:58,328"
2246,in an elevator...,"02:08:56,360","02:08:58,328"
2247,- It would still go up.,"02:08:58,440","02:09:00,320"
2248,- Elevator's not worthy.,"02:08:58,440","02:09:00,320"
2249,I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.,"02:09:00,360","02:09:02,169"

2251,I have no choice.,"02:09:04,080","02:09:05,809"

2253,of the Infinity Stones,"02:09:06,040","02:09:08,202"
2254,to show up in the last few years.,"02:09:08,320","02:09:09,731"
2255,It's not a coincidence.,"02:09:09,840","02:09:11,410"
2256,Someone has been playing,"02:09:12,240","02:09:14,004"
2257,an intricate game,"02:09:12,240","02:09:14,004"
2258,and has made pawns of us.,"02:09:14,160","02:09:15,810"
2259,And once all these pieces,"02:09:15,920","02:09:17,809"
2260,are in position...,"02:09:15,920","02:09:17,809"
2261,Triple Yahtzee.,"02:09:17,920","02:09:19,331"
2262,You think you can find out,"02:09:19,560","02:09:21,005"
2263,what's coming?,"02:09:19,560","02:09:21,005"
2264,I do.,"02:09:21,120","02:09:22,201"
2265,"Besides this one,","02:09:23,040","02:09:24,530"
2266,there's nothing that can't be explained.,"02:09:24,640","02:09:27,007"
2267,That man has no regard,"02:09:34,320","02:09:36,846"
2268,for lawn maintenance.,"02:09:34,320","02:09:36,846"
2269,"I'm gonna miss him, though.","02:09:40,000","02:09:42,606"
2270,And you're gonna miss me.,"02:09:40,000","02:09:42,606"

2272,"I will miss you, Tony.","02:09:46,480","02:09:48,130"
2273,Yeah?,"02:09:48,360","02:09:49,361"
2274,"Well, it's time for me to tap out.","02:09:49,520","02:09:51,966"
2275,Maybe I should take a page,"02:09:52,200","02:09:54,362"
2276,out of Barton's book.,"02:09:52,200","02:09:54,362"

2278,hope nobody blows it up.,"02:09:54,520","02:09:57,444"
2279,The simple life.,"02:09:58,240","02:09:59,401"
2280,- You'll get there one day.,"02:09:59,680","02:10:01,967"
2281,- I don't know.,"02:09:59,680","02:10:01,967"
2282,"Family, stability...","02:10:02,200","02:10:04,601"
2283,The guy who wanted all that,"02:10:05,760","02:10:08,889"
2284,went in the ice 75 years ago.,"02:10:05,760","02:10:08,889"
2285,I think someone else came out.,"02:10:10,400","02:10:12,243"
2286,You all right?,"02:10:16,200","02:10:17,281"
2287,I'm home.,"02:10:19,960","02:10:21,405"
2288,"You wanna keep staring at the wall,","02:10:29,320","02:10:32,085"
2289,or do you wanna go to work?,"02:10:29,320","02:10:32,085"
2290,"I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.","02:10:32,240","02:10:33,571"
2291,I thought you and Tony were,"02:10:33,760","02:10:36,764"
2292,still gazing into each other's eyes.,"02:10:33,760","02:10:36,764"
2293,How do we look?,"02:10:36,840","02:10:37,887"
2294,"Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.","02:10:38,120","02:10:40,407"
2295,We got some hitters.,"02:10:40,560","02:10:42,244"
2296,They're good. They're not a team.,"02:10:42,400","02:10:44,801"
2297,Let's beat them into shape.,"02:10:44,960","02:10:46,610"
2298,Avengers...,"02:11:05,080","02:11:06,605"
