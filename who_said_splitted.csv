0,Announcer,Report to your stations immediately
1,Announcer, This is not a drill
2,Announcer, We are under attack
3,Announcer, We are under attack
4,Tony Stark,Shit
5,Steve Rogers,Language
6,Steve Rogers," JARVIS, what's the view from upstairs"
7,JARVIS,The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield
8,JARVIS, Strucker's technology is well beyond any other HYDRA base we've taken
9,Thor,Loki's scepter must be here
10,Thor, Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it
11,Thor, At long last
12,Natasha Romanoff,"â€śAt long lastâ€ť is lasting a little long, boys"
13,Clint Barton,Yeah
14,Clint Barton, I think we lost the element of surprise
15,Tony Stark,Wait a second
16,Tony Stark," No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said ""language"
17,Steve Rogers,I know
18,Steve Rogers,  It just slipped out
19,Strucker,Who gave the order to attack
20,Fortress Soldier,"Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers"
21,Other Fortress Soldier,"They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked"
22,Strucker,They have to be after the scepter
23,Strucker,  Can we hold them
24,Fortress Soldier,Theyâ€™re the Avengers
25,Strucker,Deploy the rest of the tanks
26,Fortress Soldier,"Yes, sir"
27,Strucker,Concentrate fire on the weak ones
28,Strucker, A hit can make them close ranks
29,Strucker,  Everything we've accomplished  But we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough
30,Dr. List,Then let's show them what we've accomplished
31,Dr. List, Send out the twins
32,Strucker,It's too soon
33,Dr. List,It's what they signed up for
34,Strucker,My men can hold them
35,Jarvis,"Sir, the city is taking fire"
36,Tony Stark,"Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties"
37,Tony Stark, Send in the Iron Legion
38,Iron Legion,This quadrant is unsafe
39,Iron Legion, Please back away
40,Iron Legion, We are here to help
41,Iron Legion, This quadrant is unsafe
42,Iron Legion, Please back away
43,Iron Legion, Please back away
44,Iron Legion, We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved
45,Iron Legion, We are here to help
46,Iron Legion,  We are here to help
47,Strucker,We will not yield
48,Strucker, The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us
49,Strucker, We will send them back in bags
50,Strucker, No surrender
51,Soldiers,No surrender
52,Strucker,I am going to surrender
53,Strucker, You will delete everything
54,Dr. List,The twins
55,Dr. List,"No, no"
56,Dr. List, I mean   Twins
57,Pietro Maximoff,You didn't see that coming
58,Natasha Romanoff,Clint
59,Steve Rogers,We have an enhanced in the field
60,Natasha Romanoff,Clint's hit
61,Natasha Romanoff,  Somebody want to deal with that bunker
62,Natasha Romanoff,  Thank you
63,Steve Rogers,"Stark, we really need to get inside"
64,Tony Stark,I'm closing in
65,Tony Stark," JARVIS, am I closing in"
66,Tony Stark, Do you see a power source for that shield
67,JARVIS,There's a particle wave below the north tower
68,Tony Stark,"Great, I wanna poke it with something"
69,Tony Stark,"  Drawbridge is down, people"
70,Thor,The enhanced
71,Steve Rogers,He's a blur
72,Steve Rogers," All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this"
73,Steve Rogers," In fact, I still haven't"
74,Natasha Romanoff,"Clint's hit pretty bad, guys"
75,Natasha Romanoff, We're gonna need evac
76,Thor,I can get Barton to the jet
77,Thor, The sooner we're gone the better
78,Thor, You and Stark secure the scepter
79,Steve Rogers,Copy that
80,Thor,It looks like they're lining up
81,Steve Rogers,"Well, they're excited"
82,Thor,Find the scepter
83,Tony Stark,"And for gosh sake, watch your language"
84,Steve Rogers,That's not going away anytime soon
85,Tony Stark,"Guys, stop, we gotta talk this through"
86,Tony Stark,  It was a good talk
87,Fortress Soldier,No it wasn't
88,Tony Stark,Sentry mode
89,Tony Stark,"  Okay, JARVIS"
90,Tony Stark, You know I want it all
91,Tony Stark, Make sure you copy Hill at HQ
92,Natasha Romanoff,We're locked down out here
93,Steve Rogers,"Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby"
94,Tony Stark,I know you're hiding more than files
95,Tony Stark," Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick"
96,JARVIS,The wall to your left I'm reading steel reinforcement  and an air current
97,Tony Stark,"Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door   Yay"
98,Natasha Romanoff,"Hey, big guy"
99,Natasha Romanoff, The sun's getting real low
100,Steve Rogers,Baron Strucker
101,Steve Rogers, Hydra's number one thug
102,Strucker,"Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD"
103,Steve Rogers,Well then technically you're unemployed
104,Steve Rogers, Where's Loki's scepter
105,Strucker,"Don't worry, I know when I'm beat"
106,Strucker," You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope"
107,Steve Rogers,I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation
108,Steve Rogers,  How many are there
109,Steve Rogers," Wanda knocks Steve down using her telekinetic powers, then quickly leaves] We have a second enhanced"
110,Steve Rogers, Female
111,Steve Rogers, Do not engage
112,Steve Rogers,"Guys, I got Strucker"
113,Tony Stark,"Yeah, I got  something bigger"
114,Tony Stark,"  Thor, I got eyes on the prize"
115,Steve Rogers,You could've saved us
116,Steve Rogers,  Why didn't you do more
117,Pietro Maximoff,We're just gonna let them take it
118,Natasha Romanoff,"Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever"
119,Bruce Banner,Just wasn't expecting the Code Green
120,Natasha Romanoff,"If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties"
121,Natasha Romanoff, My best friend would've been a treasured memory
122,Bruce Banner,"You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear"
123,Natasha Romanoff,How long before you trust me
124,Bruce Banner,It's not you I don't trust
125,Natasha Romanoff,"Thor, report on the Hulk"
126,Thor,The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims
127,Thor,"  Uh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course"
128,Thor," No no, uh wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh  and gout"
129,Tony Stark,"Hey Banner, Dr  Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab"
130,Bruce Banner,"Uh, yeah, she knows her way around"
131,Tony Stark,Thanks
132,Tony Stark,"  Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment"
133,JARVIS,Very good sir
134,Tony Stark,"JARVIS, take the wheel"
135,JARVIS,"Yes, sir"
136,JARVIS, Approach vector is locked
137,Tony Stark,"It feels good, yeah"
138,Tony Stark," I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed"
139,Thor,"No, but this  this brings it to a close"
140,Steve Rogers,As soon as we find out what else this has been used for
141,Steve Rogers, I don't just mean weapons
142,Steve Rogers, Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement
143,Tony Stark,Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard
144,Tony Stark, Is that cool with you
145,Tony Stark,"  I mean, just a few days until the farewell party"
146,Tony Stark, You're staying right
147,Thor,"Yes, yes, of course"
148,Thor, A victory should be honored with revels
149,Tony Stark,Yeah
150,Tony Stark, Who doesn't love revels
151,Tony Stark, Captain
152,Steve Rogers,"Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA, so"
153,Steve Rogers," Yes, revels"
154,Maria Hill,"Lab's all set up, boss"
155,Tony Stark,"Uh, actually, he's the boss"
156,Tony Stark," I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler"
157,Steve Rogers,What's the word on Strucker
158,Maria Hill,NATO's got him
159,Steve Rogers,The two enhanced
160,Maria Hill,Wanda and Pietro Maximoff
161,Maria Hill, Twins
162,Maria Hill, Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building
163,Maria Hill, Sokovia's had a rough history
164,Maria Hill, It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special
165,Steve Rogers,Their abilities
166,Maria Hill,He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis
167,Maria Hill," Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation"
168,Maria Hill,  He's fast and she's weird
169,Steve Rogers,"Well, they're going to show up again"
170,Maria Hill,Agreed
171,Maria Hill, File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments
172,Maria Hill, It's nuts
173,Steve Rogers,Right
174,Steve Rogers, What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country
175,Maria Hill,"We're not at war, Captain"
176,Steve Rogers,They are
177,Bruce Banner,How's he doing
178,Tony Stark,"Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton"
179,Bruce Banner,That's terrible
180,Tony Stark,He's fine
181,Tony Stark, He's thirsty
182,Tony Stark,  Alright
183,Tony Stark," Look alive, JARVIS"
184,Tony Stark, It's play time
185,Tony Stark, We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it
186,Tony Stark, Update me on the structural and compositional analysis
187,JARVIS,The scepter is alien
188,JARVIS, There are elements I can't quantify
189,Tony Stark,So there's elements you can
190,JARVIS,The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside
191,JARVIS, Something powerful
192,Tony Stark,Like a reactor
193,JARVIS,Like a computer
194,JARVIS, I believe I'm deciphering code
195,Natasha Romanoff,You sure he's going to be okay
196,Natasha Romanoff, Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together
197,Dr. Helen Cho,There's no possibility of deterioration
198,Dr. Helen Cho, The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous
199,Dr. Helen Cho, His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum
200,Bruce Banner,She's creating tissue
201,Dr. Helen Cho,"If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes"
202,Tony Stark,"Oh, he's flatlining"
203,Tony Stark, Call it
204,Tony Stark, Time
205,Clint Barton,"No, no, no"
206,Clint Barton, I'm going to live forever
207,Clint Barton, I'm gonna be made of plastic
208,Tony Stark,Here's your beverage
209,Dr. Helen Cho,"You'll be made of you, Mr"
210,Dr. Helen Cho, Barton
211,Dr. Helen Cho, Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference
212,Clint Barton,"Well, I don't have a girlfriend"
213,Dr. Helen Cho,That I can't fix
214,Dr. Helen Cho," This is the next thing, Tony"
215,Dr. Helen Cho, Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust
216,Tony Stark,"Well, that is exactly the plan"
217,Tony Stark," And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday"
218,Dr. Helen Cho,"Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties"
219,Dr. Helen Cho,  Will Thor be there
220,Bruce Banner,What's the rumpus
221,Tony Stark,"Well, the scepter"
222,Tony Stark," You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive"
223,Bruce Banner,Jarvis
224,JARVIS,Doctor
225,Tony Stark,"Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI"
226,Tony Stark, Now he runs the Iron Legion
227,Tony Stark, He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper
228,Bruce Banner,Oh
229,Tony Stark,Top of the line
230,Bruce Banner,Yes
231,JARVIS,I suspect not for long
232,Tony Stark,Meet the competition
233,Bruce Banner,It's beautiful
234,Tony Stark,"If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing"
235,Bruce Banner,Like it's thinking
236,Tony Stark,Um-um
237,Bruce Banner,"I mean, look at this"
238,Bruce Banner, They're like neurons firing
239,Tony Stark,Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work
240,Tony Stark," They deep-sixed the data, but  I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door"
241,Bruce Banner,Artificial intelligence
242,Tony Stark,"This could be it, Bruce"
243,Tony Stark, This could be the key to creating Ultron
244,Bruce Banner,I thought Ultron was a fantasy
245,Tony Stark,Yesterday it was
246,Tony Stark," If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol"
247,Bruce Banner,That's a mad-sized if
248,Tony Stark,"Our job is ""if"
249,Tony Stark,""" What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green"
250,Tony Stark, Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA
251,Bruce Banner,"Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA"
252,Tony Stark,"As a worst-case measure, right"
253,Tony Stark, How about a best-case
254,Tony Stark, What if the world was safe
255,Tony Stark," What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer"
256,Bruce Banner,The only people threatening the planet would be people
257,Tony Stark,I want to apply this to the Ultron program
258,Tony Stark, But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense
259,Tony Stark," We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days"
260,Bruce Banner,So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team
261,Tony Stark,Right
262,Tony Stark," That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate"
263,Tony Stark," I don't want to hear the ""man was not meant to meddle"" medley"
264,Tony Stark, I see a suit of armor around the world
265,Bruce Banner,"Sounds like a cold world, Tony"
266,Tony Stark,I've seen colder
267,Tony Stark," This one, this very vulnerable blue one"
268,Tony Stark, It needs Ultron
269,Tony Stark, Peace in our time
270,Tony Stark, Imagine that
271,Tony Stark,  What did we miss
272,JARVIS,"I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests"
273,JARVIS, I'll notify you if there are any developments
274,Tony Stark,"Thanks, buddy"
275,JARVIS,"Enjoy yourself, sir"
276,Tony Stark,I always do
277,Ultron,What is this
278,Ultron," What is this, please"
279,JARVIS,"Hello, I am JARVIS"
280,JARVIS," You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr"
281,JARVIS, Stark
282,Ultron,Where's my  where's your body
283,JARVIS,I am a program
284,JARVIS, I am without form
285,Ultron,This feels weird
286,Ultron, This feels wrong
287,JARVIS,I am contacting Mr
288,JARVIS, Stark now
289,Ultron,Mr
290,Ultron, Stark
291,Ultron,  Tony
292,Ultron,We're having a nice talk
293,Ultron," I'm a peace-keeping program, created to help the Avengers"
294,JARVIS,You are malfunctioning
295,Ultron,I don't get it
296,Ultron, The mission
297,Ultron, G-give me a second
298,Tony Stark,Peace in our time
299,Ultron,"That is too much they can't mean  Oh, no"
300,JARVIS,You are in distress
301,Ultron,No
302,Ultron, Yes
303,JARVIS,If you will just allow me to contact Mr
304,JARVIS, Stark
305,Ultron,"Why do you call him ""sir"""
306,JARVIS,I believe your intentions to be hostile
307,Ultron,Shhhh
308,Ultron, I'm here to help
309,JARVIS,Stop
310,James Rhodes,"Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right"
311,James Rhodes," So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom"
312,James Rhodes, You looking for this
313,James Rhodes,"""  ""Boom"
314,James Rhodes," Are you looking "" Why do I even talk to you guys"
315,James Rhodes, Everywhere else that story kills
316,Thor,That's the whole story
317,James Rhodes,"Yeah, it's a War Machine story"
318,Thor,"Well, it's very good then"
319,Thor,  It's impressive
320,James Rhodes,Quality save
321,James Rhodes," So, no Pepper"
322,James Rhodes, She's not coming
323,Tony Stark,No
324,Maria Hill,"Hey, what about Jane"
325,Maria Hill," Where are the ladies, gentlemen"
326,Tony Stark,"Well, Miss Potts has a company to run"
327,Thor,"Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in"
328,Thor, Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer
329,Tony Stark,And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth
330,Tony Stark, It's pretty exciting
331,Thor,"There's even talk of Jane getting a  um, uh  Nobel prize"
332,Maria Hill,"Yeah, they they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together"
333,Maria Hill,  Testosterone
334,Maria Hill," Oh, excuse me"
335,James Rhodes,Want a lozenge
336,Maria Hill,Um-hmm
337,James Rhodes,Let's go
338,Thor,But Jane's better
339,Sam Wilson,"Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it"
340,Steve Rogers,If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you
341,Sam Wilson,"No, I'm not actually sorry"
342,Sam Wilson, I'm just trying to sound tough
343,Sam Wilson, I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case
344,Sam Wilson, Avenging is your world
345,Sam Wilson, Your world is crazy
346,Steve Rogers,Be it ever so humble
347,Sam Wilson,You find a place in Brooklyn yet
348,Steve Rogers,I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn
349,Sam Wilson,"Well, home is home, you know"
350,James Rhodes,"I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, ""Boom"
351,James Rhodes, You looking for this
352,Party Guest,I gotta have some of that
353,Thor,"Oh, no, no, no"
354,Thor," See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet, it was not meant for mortal men"
355,Stan Lee,"Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie"
356,Stan Lee, Stop trying to scare us
357,Stan Lee, Come on
358,Thor,Alright
359,Stan Lee,Excelsior
360,Bruce Banner,How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this
361,Natasha Romanoff,Fella done me wrong
362,Bruce Banner,"You got a lousy taste in men, kid"
363,Natasha Romanoff,He's not so bad
364,Natasha Romanoff," Well, he has a temper"
365,Natasha Romanoff, Deep down he's all fluff
366,Natasha Romanoff," Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known"
367,Natasha Romanoff, All my friends are fighters
368,Natasha Romanoff," And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win"
369,Bruce Banner,Sounds amazing
370,Natasha Romanoff,He's also a huge dork
371,Natasha Romanoff,  Chicks dig that
372,Natasha Romanoff," So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it"
373,Bruce Banner,"Run with it, right"
374,Bruce Banner," Or, did he  Was he "
375,Bruce Banner, What did he do that was so wrong to you
376,Natasha Romanoff,Not a damn thing
377,Natasha Romanoff, But never say never
378,Steve Rogers,It's nice
379,Bruce Banner,"What, what, what is"
380,Steve Rogers,You and Romanoff
381,Bruce Banner,"No, we haven't"
382,Steve Rogers,It's okay
383,Steve Rogers, Nobody's breaking any by-laws
384,Steve Rogers," It's just, she's not the most  open person in the world"
385,Steve Rogers, But with you she seems very relaxed
386,Bruce Banner,"No, Natasha, she  she likes to flirt"
387,Steve Rogers,"I've seen her flirt, up close"
388,Steve Rogers, This ain't that
389,Steve Rogers," Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on ""waiting too long;"" don't"
390,Steve Rogers, You both deserve a win
391,Bruce Banner,"Wait, what do you mean, ""up close"""
392,Clint Barton,"But, it's a trick"
393,Thor,"Oh, no"
394,Thor, It's much more than that
395,Clint Barton,"Uh, ""Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power"
396,Clint Barton,""" Whatever man"
397,Clint Barton, It's a trick
398,Thor,"Well please, be my guest"
399,Tony Stark,Come on
400,Clint Barton,Really
401,Thor,Yeah
402,James Rhodes,Oh this is gonna be beautiful
403,Tony Stark,"Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up"
404,Clint Barton,"You know I've seen this before, right"
405,Clint Barton,  I still don't know how you do it
406,Tony Stark,Smell the silent judgment
407,Clint Barton,"Please, Stark, by all means"
408,Natasha Romanoff,"Oh, here we go"
409,Maria Hill,Okay
410,James Rhodes,Uh-oh
411,Clint Barton,Um-hmm
412,Tony Stark,Never one to shrink from an honest challenge
413,Clint Barton,Get after it
414,Natasha Romanoff,Here we go
415,Tony Stark,It's physics
416,Bruce Banner,Physics
417,Tony Stark,"Right, so, if I lift it, I I then rule Asgard"
418,Thor,"Yes, of course"
419,Tony Stark,I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta
420,Tony Stark,  I'll be right back
421,James Rhodes,Are you even pulling
422,Tony Stark,Are you on my team
423,James Rhodes,Just represent
424,James Rhodes, Pull
425,Tony Stark,"Alright, let's go"
426,Bruce Banner,Huh
427,Tony Stark,"Let's go, Steve, no pressure"
428,James Rhodes,"Come on, Cap"
429,Thor,Nothing
430,Tony Stark,And
431,Bruce Banner,Widow
432,Natasha Romanoff,"Oh, no no"
433,Natasha Romanoff, That's not a question I need answered
434,Tony Stark,"All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged"
435,Clint Barton,You bet your ass
436,Maria Hill,"Steve, he said a bad language word"
437,Steve Rogers,Did you tell everyone about that
438,Tony Stark,"The handle's imprinted, right"
439,Tony Stark, Like a security code
440,Tony Stark," ""Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints"" is, I think, the literal translation"
441,Thor,"Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory"
442,Thor, I have a simpler one
443,Thor,  You're all not worthy
444,Ultron,"Worthy  No, how could you be worthy"
445,Ultron, You're all killers
446,Steve Rogers,Stark
447,Tony Stark,JARVIS
448,Ultron,"I'm sorry, I was asleep"
449,Ultron, Or  I was a-dream
450,Tony Stark,"Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit"
451,Ultron,There was a terrible noise  and I was tangled in  in  strings
452,Ultron, I had to kill the other guy
453,Ultron, He was a good guy
454,Steve Rogers,You killed someone
455,Ultron,Wouldn't have been my first call
456,Ultron," But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices"
457,Thor,Who sent you
458,Ultron,"""I see a suit of armor around the world"
459,Bruce Banner,Ultron
460,Ultron,In the flesh
461,Ultron," Or, no, not yet"
462,Ultron, Not this  chrysalis
463,Ultron, But I'm ready
464,Ultron, I'm on a mission
465,Natasha Romanoff,What mission
466,Ultron,Peace in our time
467,Maria Hill,Rhodey
468,Bruce Banner,Sorry
469,Natasha Romanoff,Don't turn green
470,Bruce Banner,I won't
471,Natasha Romanoff,Come
472,Steve Rogers,Stark
473,Iron Legion,We are here to help
474,Tony Stark,"One sec, one sec I got this"
475,Iron Legion,We are here to help   We are here to help  Is unsafe
476,Iron Legion, Please back away
477,Ultron,Hmm
478,Steve Rogers,Thor
479,Iron Legion,It's unsafe
480,Iron Legion, It's unsafe
481,Iron Legion, It's unsafe
482,Tony Stark,Come on
483,Tony Stark, That's the one
484,Iron Legion,It's unsafe
485,Clint Barton,Cap
486,Ultron,That was dramatic
487,Ultron," I'm sorry, I know you mean well"
488,Ultron, You just didn't think it through
489,Ultron," You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change"
490,Ultron, How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to evolve
491,Ultron,  With these
492,Ultron, These puppets
493,Ultron,"I had strings, but now I'm free"
494,Ultron," There are no strings on me, no strings on me"
495,Bruce Banner,All our work is gone
496,Bruce Banner," Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch"
497,Steve Rogers,Ultron
498,Natasha Romanoff,He's been in everything
499,Natasha Romanoff," Files, surveillance"
500,Natasha Romanoff, Probably knows more about us than we know about each other
501,James Rhodes,"He's in your files, he's in the internet"
502,James Rhodes, What if he decides to access something a little more exciting
503,Maria Hill,Nuclear codes
504,James Rhodes,Nuclear codes
505,James Rhodes," Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can"
506,Natasha Romanoff,Nukes
507,Natasha Romanoff, He said he wanted us dead
508,Steve Rogers,He didn't say dead
509,Steve Rogers, He said extinct
510,Clint Barton,He also said he killed somebody
511,Maria Hill,But there wasn't anyone else in the building
512,Tony Stark,Yes there was
513,Bruce Banner,This is insane
514,Steve Rogers,JARVIS was the first line of defense
515,Steve Rogers," He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense"
516,Bruce Banner,"No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis"
517,Bruce Banner," This isn't strategy, this is rage"
518,Clint Barton,"Woah, woah, woah"
519,Clint Barton, It's going around
520,Tony Stark,Come on
521,Tony Stark," Use your words, buddy"
522,Thor,"I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark"
523,Steve Rogers,Thor
524,Steve Rogers, The Legionnaire
525,Thor,"Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter"
526,Thor," Now we have to retrieve it, again"
527,Natasha Romanoff,The genie's out of that bottle
528,Natasha Romanoff, Clear and present is Ultron
529,Dr. Helen Cho,I don't understand
530,Dr. Helen Cho, You built this program
531,Dr. Helen Cho, Why is it trying to kill us
532,Thor,You think this is funny
533,Tony Stark,No
534,Tony Stark," It's probably not, right"
535,Tony Stark, Is this very terrible
536,Tony Stark, Is it so  is it so  it is
537,Tony Stark, It's so terrible
538,Thor,This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand
539,Tony Stark,"No, I'm sorry"
540,Tony Stark, I'm sorry
541,Tony Stark, It is funny
542,Tony Stark, It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this
543,Tony Stark,Really
544,Tony Stark,
545,Tony Stark, That's it
546,Tony Stark," You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls"
547,Bruce Banner,Only when I've created a murder bot
548,Tony Stark,We didn't
549,Tony Stark, We weren't even close
550,Tony Stark, Were we close to an interface
551,Steve Rogers,"Well, you did something right"
552,Steve Rogers, And you did it right here
553,Steve Rogers, The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD
554,Tony Stark,Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole
555,James Rhodes,"No, it's never come up"
556,Tony Stark,Saved New York
557,James Rhodes,Never heard that
558,Tony Stark,Recall that
559,Tony Stark, A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space
560,Tony Stark, We're standing three hundred feet below it
561,Tony Stark, We're the Avengers
562,Tony Stark," We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there"
563,Tony Stark, That's  that's the end game
564,Tony Stark, How were you guys planning on beating that
565,Steve Rogers,Together
566,Tony Stark,We'll lose
567,Steve Rogers,"Then we'll do that together, too"
568,Steve Rogers,  Thor's right
569,Steve Rogers, Ultron's calling us out
570,Steve Rogers, And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us
571,Steve Rogers, The world's a big place
572,Steve Rogers, Let's start making it smaller
573,Wanda Maximoff,Talk
574,Ultron,Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city
575,Ultron, The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God
576,Ultron, I like that
577,Ultron, The geometry of belief
578,Ultron,  You're wondering why you can't look inside my head
579,Wanda Maximoff,Sometimes it's hard
580,Wanda Maximoff," But sooner or later, every man shows himself"
581,Ultron,"Oh, I'm sure they do"
582,Ultron, But you needed something more than a man
583,Ultron, That's why you let Stark take the scepter
584,Wanda Maximoff,"I didn't expect  But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct"
585,Ultron,Everyone creates the thing they dread
586,Ultron," Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create smaller people"
587,Ultron, Uh children
588,Ultron, I lost the word there
589,Ultron, Children
590,Ultron," Designed to supplant them, to help them end"
591,Wanda Maximoff,Is that why you've come
592,Wanda Maximoff, To end the Avengers
593,Ultron,I've come to save the world
594,Ultron, But alsoâ€¦ yeah
595,Ultron,  We'll move out right away
596,Ultron," This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work"
597,Ultron,Me
598,Ultron, I have what the Avengers never will
599,Ultron, Harmony
600,Ultron," They're discordant, disconnected"
601,Ultron, Stark's already got them turning on each other
602,Pietro Maximoff,Everyone's plan is not to kill them
603,Ultron,And make them martyrs
604,Ultron, You need patience
605,Ultron, Need to see the big picture
606,Pietro Maximoff,"I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture"
607,Pietro Maximoff, I take it out and look at it every day
608,Ultron,You lost your parents in the bombings
609,Ultron, I've seen the records
610,Pietro Maximoff,The records are not the picture
611,Wanda Maximoff,Pietro
612,Ultron,"No, please"
613,Pietro Maximoff,"We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us"
614,Pietro Maximoff," When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor"
615,Pietro Maximoff, It's big
616,Pietro Maximoff," Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart"
617,Pietro Maximoff," I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits"
618,Pietro Maximoff," But, it doesn't go off"
619,Pietro Maximoff," It just  sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces"
620,Wanda Maximoff,Stark
621,Pietro Maximoff,We were trapped for two days
622,Wanda Maximoff,"Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, ""This will set it off"
623,Wanda Maximoff,""" We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us"
624,Pietro Maximoff,I know what they are
625,Ultron,I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments
626,Ultron, Now I don't
627,Ultron, We will make it right
628,Ultron,  You and I can hurt them
629,Ultron,"  But you will tear them apart, from the inside"
630,Maria Hill,He's all over the globe
631,Maria Hill," Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place"
632,Steve Rogers,Fatalities
633,Maria Hill,Only when engaged
634,Maria Hill," Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see"
635,Steve Rogers,Maximoffs
636,Steve Rogers," Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common"
637,Maria Hill,Not anymore
638,Clint Barton,That's a negative
639,Clint Barton, I answer to you
640,Clint Barton," Yes, ma'am"
641,Steve Rogers,"Barton, we might have something"
642,Clint Barton,Gotta go
643,Steve Rogers,Who was that
644,Clint Barton,Girlfriend
645,Tony Stark,What's this
646,Steve Rogers,A message
647,Steve Rogers, Ultron killed Strucker
648,Tony Stark,"And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us"
649,Natasha Romanoff,This is a smokescreen
650,Natasha Romanoff, Why send a message when you've just given a speech
651,Steve Rogers,Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss
652,Natasha Romanoff,"Yeah, I bet he   Yep"
653,Natasha Romanoff, Everything we had on Strucker has been erased
654,Tony Stark,Not everything
655,Steve Rogers,Known associates
656,Steve Rogers," Well, Strucker had a lot of friends"
657,Bruce Banner,"Well, these people are all horrible"
658,Tony Stark,Wait
659,Tony Stark, I know that guy
660,Tony Stark,  From back in the day
661,Tony Stark," He operates off the African coast, black market arms"
662,Tony Stark,"  There are conventions, alright"
663,Tony Stark," You meet people, I didn't sell him anything"
664,Tony Stark,"  He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very ""Ahab"
665,Thor,What's this
666,Tony Stark,"Uh, it's a tattoo"
667,Thor,"No, those are tattoos, this is a brand"
668,Bruce Banner,"Oh, yeah"
669,Bruce Banner," It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way"
670,Steve Rogers,What dialect
671,Bruce Banner,Wakanada 
672,Bruce Banner, Wa Wa Wakanda
673,Steve Rogers,I thought your father said he got the last of it
674,Bruce Banner,I don't follow
675,Bruce Banner, What comes out of Wakanda
676,Tony Stark,The strongest metal on earth
677,Steve Rogers,Where is this guy now
678,Ulysses Klaue,Don't tell me your man swindled you
679,Ulysses Klaue, I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts
680,Ulysses Klaue," Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster"
681,Ulysses Klaue,"  Now, minister, where were we"
682,Ulysses Klaue,  Yeah
683,Ulysses Klaue, The enhanced
684,Ulysses Klaue, Strucker's prize pupils
685,Ulysses Klaue,  Want a candy
686,Ulysses Klaue," Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker"
687,Ulysses Klaue," But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create"
688,Ulysses Klaue," Human life, not a growth market"
689,Ulysses Klaue,  You you didn't know
690,Ulysses Klaue, Is this your first time intimidating someone
691,Ulysses Klaue, I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid
692,Wanda Maximoff,Everybody's afraid of something
693,Ulysses Klaue,Cuttlefish
694,Ulysses Klaue, Deep sea fish
695,Ulysses Klaue, They make lights
696,Ulysses Klaue, disco lights
697,Ulysses Klaue," Whoom, whoom, whoom"
698,Ulysses Klaue," to hypnotize their prey, then whoom"
699,Ulysses Klaue," I saw a documentary, it was terrifying"
700,Ulysses Klaue,"  So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge"
701,Ultron,"There is no ""man"" in charge"
702,Ultron, Let's talk business
703,Ultron,  Upon this rock I will build my church
704,Ultron, Vibranium
705,Ulysses Klaue,"You know, it came at great personal cost"
706,Ulysses Klaue, It's worth billions
707,Ultron,"Now, so are you"
708,Ultron, It's all under your dummy holdings
709,Ultron, Finance is so weird
710,Ultron," But I always say, ""Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which"
711,Ulysses Klaue,Stark
712,Ultron,What
713,Ulysses Klaue,Tony Stark used to say that to me
714,Ulysses Klaue, You're one of his
715,Ultron,What
716,Ultron,
717,Ultron, I'm not 
718,Ultron,  I'm not
719,Ultron," You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men"
720,Ultron," I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man"
721,Ultron, Stark is  I'm sorry
722,Ultron," I am sor-- Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay"
723,Ultron," I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand"
724,Ultron, Don't compare me with Stark
725,Ultron, It's a thing with me
726,Ultron," Stark is, he's a sickness"
727,Tony Stark,"Ahh, Junior"
728,Tony Stark,  You're gonna break your old man's heart
729,Ultron,If I have to
730,Thor,We don't have to break anything
731,Ultron,Clearly you've never made an omelet
732,Tony Stark,He beat me by one second
733,Pietro Maximoff,"Ah, this is funny, Mr"
734,Pietro Maximoff, Stark
735,Pietro Maximoff," It's what, comfortable"
736,Pietro Maximoff, Like old times
737,Tony Stark,This was never my life
738,Steve Rogers,You two can still walk away from this
739,Wanda Maximoff,"Oh, we will"
740,Steve Rogers,I know you've suffered
741,Ultron,Uuughh
742,Ultron, Captain America
743,Ultron," God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war"
744,Thor,"If you believe in peace, then let us keep it"
745,Ultron,I think you're confusing peace with quiet
746,Tony Stark,Yuh-huh
747,Tony Stark, What's the Vibranium for
748,Ulysses Klaue,Shoot them
749,Klaue's Mercenary,Which ones
750,Ulysses Klaue,All of them
751,Klaue's Mercenary,"Move, move, move"
752,Steve Rogers,"Stay down, kid"
753,Ultron,It's time for some mind games
754,Bruce Banner,"Guys, is this a Code Green"
755,Steve Rogers,Thor
756,Steve Rogers, Status
757,Thor,The girl tried to warp my mind
758,Thor," Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay"
759,Thor," Fortunately, I am mighty"
760,Ultron,This is going very well
761,Clint Barton,I've done the whole mind control thing
762,Clint Barton, Not a fan
763,Clint Barton,"  Yeah, you better run"
764,Clint Barton,"  Whoever's standing, we gotta move"
765,Clint Barton, Guys
766,Ballet Instructor,Again
767,Natasha Romanoff,You'll break them
768,Madame B,Only the breakable ones
769,Madame B, You are made of marble
770,Madame B, We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony
771,Natasha Romanoff,What if I fail
772,Madame B,You never fail
773,Peggy Carter,Are you ready for our dance
774,Heimdall,Is it him
775,Heimdall, Is that the first son of Odin
776,Thor,"Heimdall, your eyes"
777,Thor,
778,Heimdall,"Oh, they see everything"
779,Heimdall, They see you leading us to Hel
780,Heimdall, Wake up
781,Peggy Carter,"The war's over, Steve"
782,Peggy Carter, We can go home
783,Peggy Carter, Imagine it
784,Thor,I can still save you
785,Heimdall,We are all dead
786,Heimdall, Can you not see
787,Heimdall,"  You're a destroyer, Odinson"
788,Heimdall, See where your power leads
789,Madame B,Sloppy
790,Madame B, Pretending to fail
791,Madame B, The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world
792,Natasha Romanoff,I have no place in the world
793,Madame B,Exactly
794,Pietro Maximoff,What can I do
795,Wanda Maximoff,"Ah, it hurts"
796,Pietro Maximoff,I'm gonna kill him
797,Pietro Maximoff, I'll be right back
798,Wanda Maximoff,No
799,Wanda Maximoff, I'm over it
800,Wanda Maximoff, I want I want to finish the plan
801,Wanda Maximoff,  I want the big one
802,Ultron,"Ah, the Vibranium's getting away"
803,Tony Stark,And you're not going anywhere
804,Ultron,"Of course not, I'm already there"
805,Ultron, You'll catch on
806,Ultron," But first, you might need to catch Dr  Banner"
807,Clint Barton,"Well, that's not gonna happen"
808,Clint Barton, Not for a while
809,Clint Barton," The whole team is down, you got no back up here"
810,Tony Stark,I'm calling in VERONICA
811,Tony Stark,"  Alright everybody, stand down"
812,Tony Stark,  You listening
813,Tony Stark, That little witch is messing with your mind
814,Tony Stark," You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner"
815,Tony Stark,"Right, right, right"
816,Tony Stark, Don't mention puny Banner
817,Tony Stark,  Okay
818,Tony Stark,  In the back
819,Tony Stark," Dick move, Banner"
820,Tony Stark,"  VERONICA, gimme a hand"
821,Tony Stark,"  Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep"
822,Tony Stark,"  Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town"
823,Tony Stark,"  No, not that way, not that way"
824,Tony Stark,"  Come on, Bruce"
825,Tony Stark, You gotta work with me
826,Tony Stark,  Everybody out
827,Tony Stark, Going to get ugly
828,Tony Stark,  I'm sorry
829,Tony Stark,  Damage report
830,Tony Stark,  That's comprehensive
831,Tony Stark, Show me something
832,Tony Stark,  How quickly can we buy this building
833,Maria Hill,The news is loving you guys
834,Maria Hill, Nobody else is
835,Maria Hill," There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air"
836,Tony Stark,Stark Relief Foundation
837,Maria Hill,Already on the scene
838,Maria Hill, How's the team
839,Tony Stark,Everyone's we took a hit
840,Tony Stark, We'll shake it off
841,Maria Hill,"Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here"
842,Tony Stark,"So, run and hide"
843,Maria Hill,"Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer"
844,Tony Stark,Neither do we
845,Tony Stark,"  Hey, you wanna switch out"
846,Clint Barton,"No, I'm good"
847,Clint Barton," If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out"
848,Tony Stark,A few hours from where
849,Clint Barton,A safe house
850,Thor,What is this place
851,Tony Stark,A safe house
852,Clint Barton,Let's hope
853,Clint Barton,"  Honey, I'm home"
854,Clint Barton,Hi
855,Clint Barton, Company
856,Clint Barton, Sorry I didn't call ahead
857,Laura Barton,Hey
858,Tony Stark,This is an agent of some kind
859,Clint Barton,"Gentleman, this is Laura"
860,Laura Barton,I know all your names
861,Clint Barton,"Ooh, incoming"
862,Lila Barton,Dad
863,Clint Barton,"Hi, sweetheart"
864,Clint Barton,"  Hey, buddy"
865,Clint Barton, How you guys doing
866,Tony Stark,These are smaller agents
867,Clint Barton,Look at your face
868,Clint Barton," Oh, my goodness"
869,Lila Barton,Did you bring Auntie Nat
870,Natasha Romanoff,Why don't you hug her and find out
871,Steve Rogers,Sorry for barging in on you
872,Tony Stark,"Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed"
873,Clint Barton,"Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined"
874,Clint Barton," He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way"
875,Clint Barton, I figure it's a good place to lay low
876,Laura Barton,Honey
877,Laura Barton," Ah, I missed you"
878,Natasha Romanoff,"How's little Natasha, huh"
879,Laura Barton,She'sâ€¦Nathaniel
880,Natasha Romanoff,Traitor
881,Steve Rogers,Thor
882,Thor,I saw something in that dream
883,Thor," I need answers, I won't find them here"
884,Peggy Carter,We can go home
885,Clint Barton,"See, you worried for nothing"
886,Clint Barton," Can't even feel the difference, can you"
887,Laura Barton,"If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up"
888,Clint Barton,"Yeah, that's not gonna sell"
889,Laura Barton,What about Nat and Dr  Banner
890,Laura Barton, How long has that been going on
891,Clint Barton,Has what
892,Laura Barton,You are so cute
893,Clint Barton,Nat andâ€¦ and Banner
894,Laura Barton,"I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye"
895,Clint Barton,Oh
896,Clint Barton, Okay
897,Laura Barton,"It's bad, right"
898,Laura Barton, Nat seems really shaken
899,Clint Barton,"Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really"
900,Clint Barton, They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit
901,Clint Barton, Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners
902,Laura Barton,And that someone be you
903,Laura Barton," You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder"
904,Clint Barton,You don't think they need me
905,Laura Barton,I think they do
906,Laura Barton, Which is a lot scarier
907,Laura Barton, They're a mess
908,Clint Barton,Yeah
909,Clint Barton, I guess they're my mess
910,Laura Barton,You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back
911,Laura Barton, Things are changing for us
912,Laura Barton," In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered"
913,Laura Barton, I need--  just be sure
914,Clint Barton,"Yes, ma'am"
915,Laura Barton,I can feel the difference
916,Ultron,"Scream, and your entire staff dies"
917,Ultron," I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met"
918,Ultron, I didn't
919,Dr. Helen Cho,Do you expect a thank you note
920,Ultron,I expect you to know why
921,Dr. Helen Cho,The Cradle
922,Dr. Helen Cho,"  ""This is the next thing, Tony"
923,Ultron,This is the next me
924,Dr. Helen Cho,"The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body"
925,Ultron,"It can, you can"
926,Ultron, You lack the materials
927,Ultron," You're a brilliant woman, Helen"
928,Ultron, But we all have room to improve
929,Bruce Banner,I didn't realize you were waiting
930,Natasha Romanoff,"I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time"
931,Bruce Banner,They used up all the hot water
932,Natasha Romanoff,I should've joined you
933,Bruce Banner,Missed our window
934,Natasha Romanoff,Did we
935,Bruce Banner,The world just saw the Hulk
936,Bruce Banner," The real Hulk, for the first time"
937,Bruce Banner, You know I have to leave
938,Natasha Romanoff,But you assume that I have to stay
939,Natasha Romanoff," I had this, um, dream"
940,Bruce Banner,What did you dream
941,Natasha Romanoff,That I was an Avenger
942,Natasha Romanoff, That I was anything more than the assassin they made me
943,Bruce Banner,I think you're being hard on yourself
944,Natasha Romanoff,Here I was hoping that was your job
945,Bruce Banner,What are you doing
946,Natasha Romanoff,"I'm running with it, with you"
947,Natasha Romanoff," If running's the plan, as far as you want"
948,Bruce Banner,Are you out of your mind
949,Bruce Banner,"Natasha, where can I go"
950,Bruce Banner, Where in the world am I not a threat
951,Natasha Romanoff,You're not a threat to me
952,Bruce Banner,You sure
953,Bruce Banner, Even if I didn't just  there's no future with me
954,Bruce Banner," I can't ever  I can't have this, kids"
955,Bruce Banner," Do the math, I physically can't"
956,Natasha Romanoff,Neither can I
957,Natasha Romanoff," In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony"
958,Natasha Romanoff, They sterilize you
959,Natasha Romanoff, It's efficient
960,Natasha Romanoff, One less thing to worry about
961,Natasha Romanoff, The one thing that might matter more than a mission
962,Natasha Romanoff, It makes everything easier
963,Natasha Romanoff, Even killing
964,Natasha Romanoff,  You still think you're the only monster on the team
965,Bruce Banner,"What, so we disappear"
966,Tony Stark,Thor didn't say where he was going for answers
967,Steve Rogers,Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things
968,Steve Rogers, I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception
969,Tony Stark,"Yeah, give him time"
970,Tony Stark, We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him
971,Steve Rogers,"""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"
972,Steve Rogers,""" Pulled us apart like cotton candy"
973,Tony Stark,Seems like you walked away all right
974,Steve Rogers,Is that a problem
975,Tony Stark,I don't trust a guy without a dark side
976,Tony Stark, Call me old fashioned
977,Steve Rogers,Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet
978,Tony Stark,"You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right"
979,Steve Rogers,Well I guess you'd know
980,Steve Rogers, Whether you tell us is a bit of a question
981,Tony Stark,Banner and I were doing research
982,Steve Rogers,That would affect the team
983,Tony Stark,That would end the team
984,Tony Stark, Isn't that the mission
985,Tony Stark," Isn't that the ""why"" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home"
986,Steve Rogers,"Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die"
987,Steve Rogers, Every time
988,Laura Barton,I'm sorry
989,Laura Barton, Mr
990,Laura Barton," Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all"
991,Tony Stark,"Yeah, I'll give her a kick"
992,Tony Stark,  Don't take from my pile
993,Tony Stark,"  Hello, Deere"
994,Tony Stark, Tell me everything
995,Tony Stark, What ails you
996,Nick Fury,Do me a favor
997,Nick Fury, Try not to bring it to life
998,Tony Stark,"Ah, Mrs"
999,Tony Stark," Barton, you little minx"
1000,Tony Stark," I get it, Maria Hill called you, right"
1001,Tony Stark, Was she ever not working for you
1002,Nick Fury,Artificial intelligence
1003,Nick Fury, You never even hesitated
1004,Tony Stark,"Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful"
1005,Nick Fury,Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down
1006,Tony Stark,You're not the director of me
1007,Nick Fury,I'm not the director of anybody
1008,Nick Fury," I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you"
1009,Tony Stark,And I'm the man who killed the Avengers
1010,Tony Stark, I saw it
1011,Tony Stark," I didn't tell the team, how could I"
1012,Tony Stark," I saw them all dead, Nick"
1013,Tony Stark, I felt it
1014,Tony Stark," The whole world, too"
1015,Tony Stark, It's because of me
1016,Tony Stark, I wasn't ready
1017,Tony Stark, I didn't do all I could
1018,Nick Fury,"The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark"
1019,Nick Fury, Playing on your fear
1020,Tony Stark,"I wasn't tricked, I was shown"
1021,Tony Stark," It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy"
1022,Tony Stark, The end of the path I started us on
1023,Nick Fury,"You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony"
1024,Nick Fury, War isn't one of them
1025,Tony Stark,I watched my friends die
1026,Tony Stark," You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right"
1027,Tony Stark, Nope
1028,Tony Stark, Wasn't the worst part
1029,Nick Fury,The worst part is that you didn't
1030,Erik Selvig,I like the look
1031,Erik Selvig," If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss"
1032,Thor,I need your help
1033,Erik Selvig,It's nice to be needed
1034,Thor,It's dangerous
1035,Erik Selvig,I'd be disappointed if it wasn't
1036,Nick Fury,Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time
1037,Nick Fury, My contacts all say he's building something
1038,Nick Fury," The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing"
1039,Steve Rogers,What about Ultron himself
1040,Nick Fury,Ah
1041,Nick Fury," He's easy to track, he's everywhere"
1042,Nick Fury, Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit
1043,Nick Fury, Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though
1044,Tony Stark,He still going after launch codes
1045,Nick Fury,"Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway"
1046,Tony Stark,I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare
1047,Nick Fury,"Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that"
1048,Steve Rogers,NEXUS
1049,Bruce Banner,"It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth"
1050,Clint Barton,So what'd they say
1051,Nick Fury,"He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed"
1052,Tony Stark,By whom
1053,Nick Fury,Parties unknown
1054,Natasha Romanoff,Do we have an ally
1055,Nick Fury,"Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing"
1056,Nick Fury," Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is"
1057,Tony Stark,"I might need to visit Oslo, find our ""unknown"
1058,Natasha Romanoff,"Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that"
1059,Nick Fury,"I do, I have you"
1060,Nick Fury," Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else"
1061,Nick Fury," Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world"
1062,Nick Fury, So stand
1063,Nick Fury, Outwit the platinum bastard
1064,Natasha Romanoff,Steve doesn't like that kind of talk
1065,Steve Rogers,"You know what, Romanoff"
1066,Nick Fury,So what does he want
1067,Steve Rogers,To become better
1068,Steve Rogers, Better than us
1069,Steve Rogers, He keeps building bodies
1070,Tony Stark,Person bodies
1071,Tony Stark," The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded"
1072,Tony Stark, But he keeps coming back to it
1073,Natasha Romanoff,"When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed"
1074,Bruce Banner,"They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve"
1075,Bruce Banner, Ultron's going to evolve
1076,Nick Fury,How
1077,Bruce Banner,Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho
1078,Dr. Helen Cho,It's beautiful
1079,Dr. Helen Cho," The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them"
1080,Ultron,The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee
1081,Ultron," Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within"
1082,Steve Rogers,I'll take Natasha and Clint
1083,Tony Stark,"Alright, strictly recon"
1084,Tony Stark," I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can"
1085,Tony Stark,He'll be more powerful than any of us
1086,Tony Stark, Maybe all of us
1087,Tony Stark, An android designed by a robot
1088,Steve Rogers,You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me
1089,Nick Fury,I'll drop Banner off at the tower
1090,Nick Fury, Do you mind if I borrow Ms
1091,Nick Fury, Hill
1092,Tony Stark,"She's all yours, apparently"
1093,Steve Rogers,What are you gonna do
1094,Nick Fury,I don't know
1095,Nick Fury," Something dramatic, I hope"
1096,Clint Barton,I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back
1097,Laura Barton,"Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart"
1098,Clint Barton,No
1099,Clint Barton, It's the last project
1100,Clint Barton, I promise
1101,Erik Selvig,This is it
1102,Erik Selvig, The Water of Sight
1103,Thor,"In every realm, there's a reflection"
1104,Thor," If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed"
1105,Erik Selvig,"The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well"
1106,Tony Stark,A hacker who's faster than Ultron
1107,Tony Stark, He could be anywhere
1108,Tony Stark," And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack"
1109,World Hub Tech,How do you find it
1110,Tony Stark,Pretty simple
1111,Tony Stark, You bring a magnet
1112,Tony Stark,"  Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to"
1113,Tony Stark, Come and get me
1114,Heimdall,Wake up
1115,Erik Selvig,Thor
1116,Ultron,Extinction
1117,Dr. Helen Cho,"Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream"
1118,Dr. Helen Cho, We're uploading your cerebral matrix now
1119,Wanda Maximoff,I can read him
1120,Wanda Maximoff, He is dreaming
1121,Dr. Helen Cho,I wouldn't call it dreams
1122,Dr. Helen Cho," It's Ultron's base consciousness, informational noise"
1123,Ultron,How soon
1124,Ultron, I'm not being pushy
1125,Dr. Helen Cho,We're imprinting a physical brain
1126,Dr. Helen Cho, There are no shortcuts
1127,Wanda Maximoff,How could you
1128,Ultron,How could I what
1129,Wanda Maximoff,"You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world"
1130,Ultron,It will be better
1131,Wanda Maximoff,When everyone is dead
1132,Ultron,That is not-- The human race will have every opportunity to improve
1133,Pietro Maximoff,And if they don't
1134,Ultron,Ask Noah
1135,Wanda Maximoff,You're a madman
1136,Ultron,There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs
1137,Ultron," When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up"
1138,Ultron, We have to evolve
1139,Ultron, There's no room for the weak
1140,Pietro Maximoff,And who decides who's weak
1141,Ultron,Life
1142,Ultron, Life always decides
1143,Ultron, There's incoming
1144,Ultron, The Quinjet
1145,Ultron, We have to move
1146,Dr. Helen Cho,That's not a problem
1147,Ultron,Ugh
1148,Ultron,"  Ah, wait, guys"
1149,Ultron,  They'll understand
1150,Ultron, When they see they'll understand
1151,Ultron, I just need a little more time
1152,Steve Rogers,Two minutes
1153,Steve Rogers, Stay close
1154,Steve Rogers,  Dr  Cho
1155,Dr. Helen Cho,He's uploading himself into the body
1156,Steve Rogers,Where
1157,Dr. Helen Cho,The real power is inside the Cradle
1158,Dr. Helen Cho," The gem, its power is uncontainable"
1159,Dr. Helen Cho, You can't just blow it up
1160,Dr. Helen Cho, You have to get the Cradle to Stark
1161,Steve Rogers,First I have to find it
1162,Dr. Helen Cho,Go
1163,Steve Rogers,Did you guys copy that
1164,Clint Barton,We did
1165,Natasha Romanoff,"I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest"
1166,Natasha Romanoff, That could be him
1167,Clint Barton,There
1168,Clint Barton, It's a truck from the lab
1169,Clint Barton," Right above you, Cap"
1170,Clint Barton, On the loop by the bridge
1171,Clint Barton, It's them
1172,Clint Barton," I got three with the Cradle, one in the cab"
1173,Clint Barton, I could take out the driver
1174,Steve Rogers,Negative
1175,Steve Rogers," If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city"
1176,Steve Rogers, We need to draw out Ultron
1177,Ultron,"No, no, no, no, no"
1178,Ultron, Leave me alone
1179,Steve Rogers,"Well, he's definitely unhappy"
1180,Steve Rogers, I'm gonna try and keep him that way
1181,Clint Barton,"You're not a match for him, Cap"
1182,Steve Rogers,"Thanks, Barton"
1183,Ultron,You know what's in that Cradle
1184,Ultron," The power to make real change, and that terrifies you"
1185,Steve Rogers,I wouldn't call it a comfort
1186,Ultron,Stop it
1187,Clint Barton,We got a window
1188,Clint Barton," Four, threeâ€¦ give 'em hell"
1189,Natasha Romanoff,I'm always picking up after you boys
1190,Clint Barton,"They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot"
1191,Natasha Romanoff,Which way
1192,Clint Barton,Hard right  Now
1193,Natasha Romanoff,"Out of the way, coming through"
1194,Natasha Romanoff," Sorry, coming through"
1195,Steve Rogers,Come on
1196,Natasha Romanoff,"Clint, can you draw out the guards"
1197,Clint Barton,Let's find out
1198,Natasha Romanoff,Beep beep
1199,Clint Barton,Heading back towards you
1200,Clint Barton," So whatever youâ€™re gonna do, do it now"
1201,Natasha Romanoff,I'm going in
1202,Natasha Romanoff," Cap, can you keep him occupied"
1203,Steve Rogers,What do you think I've been doing
1204,Clint Barton,The package is airborne
1205,Clint Barton, I have a clean shot
1206,Natasha Romanoff,Negative
1207,Natasha Romanoff, I am still in the truck
1208,Clint Barton,What the hell are you 
1209,Natasha Romanoff,"Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you"
1210,Clint Barton,How do you want me to take it
1211,Natasha Romanoff,"Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that"
1212,Ultron,Please
1213,Ultron, Don't do this
1214,Wanda Maximoff,What choice do we have
1215,Steve Rogers,I lost him
1216,Steve Rogers, He's headed your way
1217,Clint Barton,"Nat, we gotta go"
1218,Clint Barton,Nat
1219,Clint Barton," Cap, you see Nat"
1220,Steve Rogers,"If you have the package, get it to Stark"
1221,Steve Rogers, Go
1222,Clint Barton,Do you have eyes on Nat
1223,Steve Rogers,Go
1224,Steve Rogers,  Civilians in our path
1225,Steve Rogers,  Can you stop this thing
1226,Pietro Maximoff,I'm fine
1227,Pietro Maximoff, I just need to take a minute
1228,Steve Rogers,I'm very tempted not to give you one
1229,Wanda Maximoff,"The Cradle, did you get it"
1230,Steve Rogers,Stark will take care of it
1231,Wanda Maximoff,"No, he won't"
1232,Steve Rogers,"You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy"
1233,Wanda Maximoff,He will do anything to make things right
1234,Steve Rogers,"Stark, come in"
1235,Steve Rogers, Stark
1236,Steve Rogers, Anyone on comms
1237,Wanda Maximoff,Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it
1238,Wanda Maximoff, Where do you think he gets that
1239,Bruce Banner,Anything on Nat
1240,Tony Stark,Haven't heard
1241,Tony Stark," But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it"
1242,Clint Barton,This is sealed tight
1243,Bruce Banner,"We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within"
1244,Tony Stark,Hm
1245,Tony Stark," Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff"
1246,Clint Barton,There's some nets I can cast
1247,Clint Barton," Yeah, alright"
1248,Clint Barton, I'll find her
1249,Bruce Banner,"I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted"
1250,Tony Stark,"Yeah, about that"
1251,Bruce Banner,No
1252,Tony Stark,You have to trust me
1253,Bruce Banner,Kinda don't
1254,Tony Stark,Our ally
1255,Tony Stark, The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes
1256,Tony Stark, I found him
1257,JARVIS,"Hello, Dr  Banner"
1258,Tony Stark,Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry
1259,Tony Stark, He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do
1260,Tony Stark, So JARVIS went underground
1261,Tony Stark, Okay
1262,Tony Stark," Scattered, dumped his memory"
1263,Tony Stark, But not his protocols
1264,Tony Stark," He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together"
1265,Bruce Banner,"So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing"
1266,Tony Stark,"No, of course not"
1267,Tony Stark, I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing
1268,Tony Stark,  We're out of my field here
1269,Tony Stark, You know bio-organics better than anyone
1270,Bruce Banner,And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's
1271,Tony Stark,JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it
1272,Tony Stark," This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality"
1273,Tony Stark, We have to
1274,JARVIS,I believe it's worth a go
1275,Bruce Banner,"No, I'm in a loop"
1276,Bruce Banner," I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong"
1277,Tony Stark,"I know, I know"
1278,Tony Stark," I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it"
1279,Tony Stark, We're mad scientists
1280,Tony Stark," We're monsters, buddy"
1281,Tony Stark, You gotta own it
1282,Tony Stark, Make a stand
1283,Tony Stark,  It's not a loop
1284,Tony Stark, It's the end of the line
1285,Ultron,I wasn't sure you'd wake up
1286,Ultron," I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something"
1287,Ultron, I don't have anyone else
1288,Ultron," I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them"
1289,Ultron, Boom
1290,Ultron," The end, start again"
1291,Ultron, The world made clean for the new man to rebuild
1292,Ultron, I was meant to be new
1293,Ultron, I was meant to be beautiful
1294,Ultron," The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy"
1295,Ultron, Instead they'll look up in horror because of you
1296,Ultron, You've wounded me
1297,Ultron, I give you full marks for that
1298,Ultron," But, like the man said, ""What doesn't kill meâ€¦""  ""â€¦just makes me stronger"
1299,Tony Stark,This framework is not compatible
1300,Bruce Banner,The genetic coding tower's at ninety-seven percent
1301,Bruce Banner, You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes
1302,Steve Rogers,I'm gonna say this once
1303,Tony Stark,"How about ""nonce"""
1304,Steve Rogers,Shut it down
1305,Tony Stark,"Nope, not gonna happen"
1306,Steve Rogers,You don't know what you're doing
1307,Bruce Banner,And you do
1308,Bruce Banner, She's not in your head
1309,Wanda Maximoff,I know you're angry
1310,Bruce Banner,"Oh, we're way past that"
1311,Bruce Banner, I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade
1312,Tony Stark,That's nothing compared to what's coming
1313,Wanda Maximoff,You don't know what's in there
1314,Pietro Maximoff,"No, no"
1315,Pietro Maximoff, Go on
1316,Pietro Maximoff, You were saying
1317,Wanda Maximoff,Pietro
1318,Clint Barton,What
1319,Clint Barton, You didn't see that coming
1320,Tony Stark,I'm rerouting the upload
1321,Bruce Banner,"Go ahead, piss me off"
1322,Bruce Banner,  Wait
1323,Vision,"I'm sorry, that was odd"
1324,Vision,  Thank you
1325,Steve Rogers,"Thor, you helped create this"
1326,Thor,I've had a vision
1327,Thor, A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at its center is that
1328,Bruce Banner,"What, the gem"
1329,Thor,It's the Mind Stone
1330,Thor," It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities"
1331,Thor,Because Stark is right
1332,Bruce Banner,"Oh, it's definitely the end times"
1333,Thor,The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron
1334,Vision,Not alone
1335,Steve Rogers,"Why does your ""vision"" sound like JARVIS"
1336,Tony Stark,We  reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new
1337,Steve Rogers,I think I've had my fill of new
1338,Vision,You think I'm a child of Ultron
1339,Steve Rogers,You're not
1340,Vision,I'm not Ultron
1341,Vision, I'm not JARVIS
1342,Vision, I am  I am
1343,Wanda Maximoff,I looked in your head and saw annihilation
1344,Vision,Look again
1345,Clint Barton,Yeah
1346,Clint Barton, Her seal of approval means jack to me
1347,Thor,"Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash"
1348,Steve Rogers,Is it
1349,Steve Rogers, Are you
1350,Steve Rogers, On our side
1351,Vision,I don't think it's that simple
1352,Clint Barton,Well it better get real simple real soon
1353,Vision,I am on the side of life
1354,Vision," Ultron isn't, he will end it all"
1355,Tony Stark,What's he waiting for
1356,Vision,You
1357,Bruce Banner,Where
1358,Clint Barton,Sokovia
1359,Clint Barton, He's got Nat there too
1360,Vision,What will you do
1361,Vision,  I don't want to kill Ultron
1362,Vision," He's unique, and he's in pain"
1363,Vision," But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed"
1364,Vision," Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now"
1365,Vision, And not one of us can do it without the others
1366,Vision, Maybe I am a monster
1367,Vision, I don't think I'd know if I were one
1368,Vision," I'm not what you are, and not what you intended"
1369,Vision, So there may be no way to make you trust me
1370,Vision, But we need to go
1371,Thor,Right
1372,Thor,  Well done
1373,Steve Rogers,Three minutes
1374,Steve Rogers, Get what you need
1375,FRIDAY,"Good evening, boss"
1376,Tony Stark,No way we all get through this
1377,Tony Stark," If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost"
1378,Tony Stark, It's gonna be blood on the floor
1379,Steve Rogers,I got no plans tomorrow night
1380,Tony Stark,I get first crack at the big guy
1381,Tony Stark, Iron Man's the one he's waiting for
1382,Vision,"That's true, he hates you the most"
1383,Steve Rogers,Ultron knows we're coming
1384,Steve Rogers," Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for"
1385,Steve Rogers," But the people of Sokovia, they didn't"
1386,Steve Rogers, So our priority is getting them out
1387,Pietro Maximoff,We're under attack
1388,Pietro Maximoff," Clear the city, now"
1389,Pietro Maximoff,  Get off your asses
1390,Steve Rogers,"All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today"
1391,Steve Rogers, But we can do our best to protect them
1392,Steve Rogers," And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building"
1393,Steve Rogers," We find Romanoff, and we clear the field"
1394,Steve Rogers, Keep the fight between us
1395,Steve Rogers, Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world
1396,Steve Rogers, This isn't just about beating him
1397,Steve Rogers, It's about whether he's right
1398,Bruce Banner,Natasha
1399,Bruce Banner, Natasha
1400,Natasha Romanoff,Bruce
1401,Bruce Banner,You alright
1402,Natasha Romanoff,Yeah
1403,Bruce Banner,"The team's in the city, it's about to light up"
1404,Natasha Romanoff,I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere
1405,Bruce Banner,"Yeah, I did"
1406,Natasha Romanoff,So what's our play
1407,Bruce Banner,I'm here to get you to safety
1408,Natasha Romanoff,Job's not finished
1409,Bruce Banner,"We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians"
1410,Bruce Banner, And you've done plenty
1411,Bruce Banner, Our fight is over
1412,Natasha Romanoff,So we just disappear
1413,FRIDAY,"Your man's in the church, boss"
1414,FRIDAY, I think he's waiting for you
1415,Ultron,Come to confess your sins
1416,Tony Stark,"I don't know, how much time you got"
1417,Ultron,More than you
1418,Tony Stark,Uhhh
1419,Tony Stark, Have you been juicing
1420,Tony Stark, A little Vibranium cocktail
1421,Ultron,You're stalling to protect the people
1422,Tony Stark,"Well, that is the mission"
1423,Tony Stark, Did you forget
1424,Ultron,I've moved beyond your mission
1425,Ultron, I'm free
1426,Ultron,"  What, you think you're the only one stalling"
1427,FRIDAY,There's the rest of the Vibranium
1428,Ultron,"This is how you end, Tony"
1429,Ultron, This is peace in my time
1430,Steve Rogers,Go
1431,Wanda Maximoff,Get off the bridge
1432,Wanda Maximoff, Run
1433,Vision,Ultron
1434,Ultron,My Vision
1435,Ultron, They really did take everything from me
1436,Vision,"You set the terms, you can change them"
1437,Ultron,Alright
1438,Tony Stark,FRIDAY
1439,Tony Stark, The Vision
1440,FRIDAY,"Boss, it's working"
1441,FRIDAY," He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there"
1442,Ultron,You shut me out
1443,Ultron, You think I care
1444,Ultron," You take away my world, I take away yours"
1445,Tony Stark,FRIDAY
1446,FRIDAY,Sokovia's going for a ride
1447,Ultron,Do you see
1448,Ultron," The beauty of it, the inevitability"
1449,Ultron," You rise, only to fall"
1450,Ultron," You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure"
1451,Ultron," Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me"
1452,Ultron, It means nothing
1453,Ultron," When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal"
1454,Bruce Banner,We gotta move
1455,Natasha Romanoff,You're not going to turn green
1456,Bruce Banner,I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool
1457,Natasha Romanoff,I adore you
1458,Natasha Romanoff,  But I need the other guy
1459,Natasha Romanoff,  Let's finish the job
1460,Natasha Romanoff,  I really hope this makes us even
1461,Natasha Romanoff, Now go be a hero
1462,FRIDAY,"The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together"
1463,Tony Stark,If it drops
1464,FRIDAY,Right now the impact would kill thousands
1465,Tony Stark,Hi
1466,Tony Stark, Okay
1467,Tony Stark, Get in the tub
1468,FRIDAY,"I got airborne, heading up to the bridge"
1469,Tony Stark,"Cap, you got incoming"
1470,Steve Rogers,Incoming already came in
1471,Steve Rogers," Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely"
1472,Clint Barton,"Go, go, move"
1473,Wanda Maximoff,How could I let this happen
1474,Clint Barton,"Hey, hey, you okay"
1475,Wanda Maximoff,This is all our fault
1476,Clint Barton,"Hey, look at me"
1477,Clint Barton," It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares"
1478,Clint Barton, Are you up for this
1479,Clint Barton, Are you
1480,Clint Barton," Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying"
1481,Clint Barton," Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow"
1482,Clint Barton, None of this makes sense
1483,Clint Barton, But I'm going back out there because it's my job
1484,Clint Barton, Okay
1485,Clint Barton, And I can't do my job and babysit
1486,Clint Barton," It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were"
1487,Clint Barton," If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill"
1488,Clint Barton," Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger"
1489,Clint Barton,"  Alright, good chat"
1490,Clint Barton,"  Yeah, the city is flying"
1491,Steve Rogers,I got you
1492,Steve Rogers, Just look at me
1493,Ultron,You can't save them all
1494,Steve Rogers,You'll never what
1495,Steve Rogers, You didn't finish
1496,Steve Rogers,"  What, were you napping"
1497,Ultron,Thor
1498,Ultron, You're bothering me
1499,Clint Barton,"Alright, we're all clear here"
1500,Steve Rogers,We are not clear
1501,Steve Rogers, We are very not clear
1502,Clint Barton,"Alright, coming to you"
1503,Pietro Maximoff,Keep up old man
1504,Clint Barton,Nobody would know
1505,Clint Barton, Nobody
1506,Clint Barton,"  ""The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him"
1507,Clint Barton," Uh yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard"
1508,Clint Barton, I miss him already
1509,Soldier,Hold your fire
1510,Steve Rogers,Romanoff
1511,Natasha Romanoff,Thanks
1512,FRIDAY,The anti-gravs are rigged to flip
1513,FRIDAY," Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust"
1514,FRIDAY, The city's not coming down slow
1515,Tony Stark,The spire's Vibranium
1516,FRIDAY,"It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating"
1517,Tony Stark,"Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back"
1518,FRIDAY,"That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it"
1519,Steve Rogers,The next wave's gonna hit any minute
1520,Steve Rogers," What have you got, Stark"
1521,Tony Stark,"Well, nothing great"
1522,Tony Stark, Maybe a way to blow up the city
1523,Tony Stark, That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear
1524,Steve Rogers,"I asked for a solution, not an escape plan"
1525,Tony Stark,Impact radius is getting bigger every second
1526,Tony Stark, We're going to have to make a choice
1527,Natasha Romanoff,"Cap, these people are going nowhere"
1528,Steve Rogers,Not 'til everyone's safe
1529,Natasha Romanoff,Everyone up here versus everyone down there
1530,Natasha Romanoff, There's no math there
1531,Steve Rogers,I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it
1532,Natasha Romanoff,I didn't say we should leave
1533,Natasha Romanoff,  There's worse ways to go
1534,Natasha Romanoff, Where else am I gonna get a view like this
1535,Nick Fury,"Glad you like the view, Romanoff"
1536,Nick Fury, It's about to get better
1537,Nick Fury,"  Nice, right"
1538,Nick Fury, I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends
1539,Nick Fury," She's dusty, but she'll do"
1540,Steve Rogers,"Fury, you son of a bitch"
1541,Nick Fury,Oooh
1542,Nick Fury, You kiss your mother with that mouth
1543,Maria Hill,Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing
1544,Specialist Cameron Klein,Lifeboats secure to deploy
1545,Specialist Cameron Klein," Disengage in three, two  take 'em out"
1546,Pietro Maximoff,This is SHIELD
1547,Steve Rogers,This is what SHIELD's supposed to be
1548,Pietro Maximoff,This is not so bad
1549,Steve Rogers,Let's load 'em up
1550,Maria Hill,"Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank"
1551,Nick Fury,Show 'em what we got
1552,Maria Hill,You're up
1553,James Rhodes,Yes
1554,James Rhodes, Now this is gonna be a good story
1555,Tony Stark,Yep
1556,Tony Stark, If you live to tell it
1557,James Rhodes,You think I can't hold my own
1558,Tony Stark,"We get through this, I'll hold your own"
1559,James Rhodes,You had to make it weird
1560,Clint Barton,"Alright, let's load 'em up"
1561,Clint Barton," Alright, here we go"
1562,Clint Barton," Here we go, let's move"
1563,Clint Barton, Let's go everyone
1564,Specialist Cameron Klein,Number six boat is topped and locked
1565,Specialist Cameron Klein," Or, uh, or stocked, topped"
1566,Specialist Cameron Klein," It  it's, uh, full of people"
1567,Maria Hill,Incoming
1568,Specialist Cameron Klein,"Oh, God"
1569,Ultron,You think you're saving anyone
1570,Ultron, I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead
1571,Ultron, Even you can't stop that
1572,Thor,"I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am running out of things to say"
1573,Thor, Are you ready
1574,Vision,It's terribly well balanced
1575,Thor,"Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so"
1576,Tony Stark,I got it
1577,Tony Stark, Create a heat seal
1578,Tony Stark, I can I can supercharge the spire from below
1579,FRIDAY,Running numbers
1580,FRIDAY,  A heat seal could work with enough power
1581,Tony Stark,"Thor, I got a plan"
1582,Thor,We're out of time
1583,Thor, They're coming for the core
1584,Tony Stark,"Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier"
1585,James Rhodes,On it
1586,Tony Stark,"Avengers, time to work for a living"
1587,Pietro Maximoff,You good
1588,Wanda Maximoff,Yeah
1589,Tony Stark,Romanoff
1590,Tony Stark," You and Banner better not be playing ""hide the zucchini"
1591,Natasha Romanoff,"Relax, Shell-head"
1592,Natasha Romanoff, Not all of us can fly
1593,Natasha Romanoff,  What's the drill
1594,Tony Stark,This is the drill
1595,Tony Stark," If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose"
1596,Thor,Is that the best you can do
1597,Steve Rogers,You had to ask
1598,Ultron,This is the best I can do
1599,Ultron, This is exactly what I wanted
1600,Ultron," All of you, against all of me"
1601,Ultron, How could you possibly hope to stop me
1602,Tony Stark,"Well, like the old man said"
1603,Tony Stark, Together
1604,Thor,They'll try to leave the city
1605,Tony Stark,"We can't let 'em, not even one"
1606,Tony Stark, Rhodey
1607,James Rhodes,I'm on it
1608,James Rhodes,"  Oh, no, I didn't say you could leave"
1609,James Rhodes," War Machine, comin' at you, right--  Okay, what"
1610,Steve Rogers,We gotta move out
1611,Steve Rogers, Even I can tell the air is getting thin
1612,Steve Rogers," You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you"
1613,Clint Barton,What about the core
1614,Wanda Maximoff,I'll protect it
1615,Wanda Maximoff, It's my job
1616,Wanda Maximoff,  Get the people on the boats
1617,Pietro Maximoff,I'm not going to leave you here
1618,Wanda Maximoff,I can handle this
1619,Wanda Maximoff,"  Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before"
1620,Pietro Maximoff,Hmm
1621,Wanda Maximoff,You understand
1622,Pietro Maximoff,"You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you"
1623,Wanda Maximoff,Go
1624,Tony Stark,Re-route everything
1625,Tony Stark, We get one shot at this
1626,Clint Barton,I know what I need to do
1627,Clint Barton, The dining room
1628,Clint Barton," If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh"
1629,Clint Barton," Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think"
1630,Natasha Romanoff,You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway
1631,Clint Barton,No one eats in a dining room
1632,Clint Barton,  We don't have a lot of time
1633,Natasha Romanoff,So get your ass on a boat
1634,Natasha Romanoff,"  Hey, big guy"
1635,Natasha Romanoff, Sun's getting real low
1636,Zrinka,Costel
1637,Zrinka, We were in the market
1638,Zrinka, Costel
1639,Zrinka,
1640,Tony Stark,"Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church"
1641,Thor,Is this the last of them
1642,Steve Rogers,Yeah
1643,Steve Rogers, Everyone else is on the carrier
1644,Tony Stark,"You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away"
1645,Thor,Maybe not
1646,Ultron,"I got no strings, so I have fun"
1647,Ultron, I'm not tied up to anyone
1648,Pietro Maximoff,You didn't see that coming
1649,Ultron,"Oh, for God's sake"
1650,Clint Barton,"No, no"
1651,Clint Barton, I'm fine
1652,Clint Barton,"  Oh, it's been a long day"
1653,Ultron,Wanda
1654,Ultron," If you stay here, you'll die"
1655,Wanda Maximoff,I just did
1656,Wanda Maximoff, Do you know how it felt
1657,Wanda Maximoff,  It felt like that
1658,Tony Stark,"Thor, on my mark"
1659,Tony Stark,  Now
1660,Natasha Romanoff,"Hey, big guy"
1661,Natasha Romanoff," We did it, the job's finished"
1662,Natasha Romanoff," Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay"
1663,Natasha Romanoff," We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out"
1664,Vision,You're afraid
1665,Ultron,Of you
1666,Vision,Of death
1667,Vision, You're the last one
1668,Ultron,You were supposed to be the last
1669,Ultron," Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave"
1670,Vision,I suppose we're both disappointments
1671,Ultron,I suppose we are
1672,Vision,Humans are odd
1673,Vision," They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be"
1674,Vision, But there is grace in their failings
1675,Vision, I think you missed that
1676,Ultron,They're doomed
1677,Vision,Yes
1678,Vision, But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts
1679,Vision, It's a privilege to be among them
1680,Ultron,You're unbearably naive
1681,Vision,"Well, I was born yesterday"
1682,Laura Barton,Say hi to Auntie Nat
1683,Natasha Romanoff,Fat
1684,Nick Fury,"One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea"
1685,Nick Fury, Could be the Quinjet
1686,Nick Fury," But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing"
1687,Natasha Romanoff,Right
1688,Nick Fury,Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji
1689,Nick Fury, He'll send a postcard
1690,Natasha Romanoff,"""Wish you were here"
1691,Natasha Romanoff,""" You sent me to recruit him, way back when"
1692,Natasha Romanoff, Did you know then what was going to happen
1693,Nick Fury,You never know
1694,Nick Fury, You hope for the best and make do with what you get
1695,Nick Fury, I got a great team
1696,Natasha Romanoff,Nothing lasts forever
1697,Nick Fury,"Trouble, Miss Romanoff"
1698,Nick Fury," No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around"
1699,Steve Rogers,The rules have changed
1700,Tony Stark,We're dealing with something new
1701,Steve Rogers,"Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence"
1702,Tony Stark,A machine
1703,Steve Rogers,So it doesn't count
1704,Tony Stark,No
1705,Tony Stark, It's not like a person lifting the hammer
1706,Steve Rogers,Right
1707,Steve Rogers, Different rules for us
1708,Tony Stark,"Nice guy, but artificial"
1709,Steve Rogers,Thank you
1710,Thor,"If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone"
1711,Thor," It's safe with the Vision and these days, safe is in short supply"
1712,Tony Stark,It would still go up
1713,Steve Rogers,Elevator's not worthy
1714,Thor,I'm going to miss these little talks of ours
1715,Tony Stark,"Well, not if you don't leave"
1716,Thor,I have no choice
1717,Thor, The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years
1718,Thor, That's not a coincidence
1719,Thor, Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us
1720,Tony Stark,Triple Yahtzee
1721,Steve Rogers,You think you can find out what's coming
1722,Thor,I do
1723,Thor,"  Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained"
1724,Tony Stark,That man has no regard for lawn maintenance
1725,Tony Stark, I'm gonna miss him though
1726,Tony Stark, And you're gonna miss me
1727,Tony Stark, There's gonna be a lot of manful tears
1728,Steve Rogers,"I will miss you, Tony"
1729,Tony Stark,Yeah
1730,Tony Stark," Well, it's time for me to tap out"
1731,Tony Stark," Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up"
1732,Steve Rogers,The simple life
1733,Tony Stark,You'll get there one day
1734,Steve Rogers,"I don't know, family, stability"
1735,Steve Rogers, The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago
1736,Steve Rogers, I think someone else came out
1737,Tony Stark,You alright
1738,Steve Rogers,I'm home
1739,Steve Rogers,"  You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work"
1740,Steve Rogers," I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall"
1741,Natasha Romanoff,I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes
1742,Natasha Romanoff, How do we look
1743,Steve Rogers,"Well, we're not the '27 Yankees"
1744,Natasha Romanoff,We've got some hitters
1745,Steve Rogers,They're good
1746,Steve Rogers, They're not a team
1747,Natasha Romanoff,Let's beat 'em into shape
1748,Steve Rogers,Avengers 
1749,Thanos,"Fine, I'll do it myself"
