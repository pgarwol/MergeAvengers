2,Announcer, We are under attack
3,Announcer, We are under attack
4,Tony Stark,Shit
5,Steve Rogers,Language
6,Steve Rogers," JARVIS, what's the view from upstairs"
7,JARVIS,The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield
8,JARVIS, Strucker's technology is well beyond any other HYDRA base we've taken
9,Thor,Loki's scepter must be here
10,Thor, Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it
11,Thor, At long last
12,Natasha Romanoff,"â€śAt long lastâ€ť is lasting a little long, boys"
13,Clint Barton,Yeah
14,Clint Barton, I think we lost the element of surprise
15,Tony Stark,Wait a second
16,Tony Stark, No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said language
17,Steve Rogers,I know
18,Steve Rogers,  It just slipped out
19,Strucker,Who gave the order to attack
20,Fortress Soldier,"Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers"
21,Other Fortress Soldier,"They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked"
22,Strucker,They have to be after the scepter
23,Strucker,  Can we hold them
24,Fortress Soldier,Theyâ€™re the Avengers
25,Strucker,Deploy the rest of the tanks
26,Fortress Soldier,"Yes, sir"
27,Strucker,Concentrate fire on the weak ones
28,Strucker, A hit can make them close ranks
29,Strucker,  Everything we've accomplished
30,Strucker, But we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough
31,Dr. List,Then let's show them what we've accomplished
32,Dr. List, Send out the twins
33,Strucker,It's too soon
34,Dr. List,It's what they signed up for
35,Strucker,My men can hold them
36,Jarvis,"Sir, the city is taking fire"
37,Tony Stark,"Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties"
38,Tony Stark, Send in the Iron Legion
39,Iron Legion,This quadrant is unsafe
40,Iron Legion, Please back away
41,Iron Legion, We are here to help
42,Iron Legion, This quadrant is unsafe
43,Iron Legion, Please back away
44,Iron Legion, Please back away
45,Iron Legion, We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved
46,Iron Legion, We are here to help
47,Iron Legion,  We are here to help
48,Strucker,We will not yield
49,Strucker, The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us
50,Strucker, We will send them back in bags
51,Strucker, No surrender
52,Soldiers,No surrender
53,Strucker,I am going to surrender
54,Strucker, You will delete everything
55,Dr. List,The twins
56,Dr. List,"No, no"
57,Dr. List, I mean
58,Dr. List,  Twins
59,Pietro Maximoff,You didn't see that coming
60,Natasha Romanoff,Clint
61,Steve Rogers,We have an enhanced in the field
62,Natasha Romanoff,Clint's hit
63,Natasha Romanoff,  Somebody want to deal with that bunker
64,Natasha Romanoff,  Thank you
65,Steve Rogers,"Stark, we really need to get inside"
66,Tony Stark,I'm closing in
67,Tony Stark," JARVIS, am I"
68,Tony Stark,closing in
69,Tony Stark, Do you see a power source for that shield
70,JARVIS,There's a particle wave below the north tower
71,Tony Stark,"Great, I wanna poke it with something"
72,Tony Stark,"  Drawbridge is down, people"
73,Thor,The enhanced
74,Steve Rogers,He's a blur
75,Steve Rogers," All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this"
76,Steve Rogers," In fact, I still haven't"
77,Natasha Romanoff,"Clint's hit pretty bad, guys"
78,Natasha Romanoff, We're gonna need evac
79,Thor,I can get Barton to the jet
80,Thor, The sooner we're gone the better
81,Thor, You and Stark secure the scepter
82,Steve Rogers,Copy that
83,Thor,It looks like they're lining up
84,Steve Rogers,"Well, they're excited"
85,Thor,Find the scepter
86,Tony Stark,"And for gosh sake, watch your language"
87,Steve Rogers,That's not going away anytime soon
88,Tony Stark,"Guys, stop, we gotta talk this through"
89,Tony Stark,  It was a good talk
90,Fortress Soldier,No it wasn't
91,Tony Stark,Sentry mode
92,Tony Stark,"  Okay, JARVIS"
93,Tony Stark, You know I want it all
94,Tony Stark, Make sure you copy Hill at HQ
95,Natasha Romanoff,We're locked down out here
96,Steve Rogers,"Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby"
97,Tony Stark,I know you're hiding more than files
98,Tony Stark," Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick"
99,JARVIS,The wall to your left
100,JARVIS,I'm reading steel reinforcement
101,JARVIS, and an air current
102,Tony Stark,"Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door"
103,Tony Stark,  Yay
104,Natasha Romanoff,"Hey, big guy"
105,Natasha Romanoff, The sun's getting real low
106,Steve Rogers,Baron Strucker
107,Steve Rogers, Hydra's number one thug
108,Strucker,"Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD"
109,Steve Rogers,Well then technically you're unemployed
110,Steve Rogers, Where's Loki's scepter
111,Strucker,"Don't worry, I know when I'm beat"
112,Strucker," You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope"
113,Steve Rogers,I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation
114,Steve Rogers,  How many are there
115,Steve Rogers," Wanda knocks Steve down using her telekinetic powers, then quickly leaves] We have a second enhanced"
116,Steve Rogers, Female
117,Steve Rogers, Do not engage
118,Steve Rogers,"Guys, I got Strucker"
119,Tony Stark,"Yeah, I got"
120,Tony Stark, something bigger
121,Tony Stark,"  Thor, I got eyes on the prize"
122,Steve Rogers,You could've saved us
123,Steve Rogers,  Why didn't you do more
124,Pietro Maximoff,We're just gonna let them take it
125,Natasha Romanoff,"Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever"
126,Bruce Banner,Just wasn't expecting the Code Green
127,Natasha Romanoff,"If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties"
128,Natasha Romanoff, My best friend would've been a treasured memory
129,Bruce Banner,"You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear"
130,Natasha Romanoff,How long before you trust me
131,Bruce Banner,It's not you I don't trust
132,Natasha Romanoff,"Thor, report on the Hulk"
133,Thor,The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims
134,Thor,"  Uh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course"
135,Thor," No no, uh"
136,Thor,"wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh"
137,Thor, and gout
138,Tony Stark,"Hey Banner, Dr  Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab"
139,Bruce Banner,"Uh, yeah, she knows her way around"
140,Tony Stark,Thanks
141,Tony Stark,"  Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment"
142,JARVIS,Very good sir
143,Tony Stark,"JARVIS, take the wheel"
144,JARVIS,"Yes, sir"
145,JARVIS, Approach vector is locked
146,Tony Stark,"It feels good, yeah"
147,Tony Stark," I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed"
148,Tony Stark," Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but"
149,Thor,"No, but this"
150,Thor, this brings it to a close
151,Steve Rogers,As soon as we find out what else this has been used for
152,Steve Rogers, I don't just mean weapons
153,Steve Rogers, Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement
154,Tony Stark,Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard
155,Tony Stark, Is that cool with you
156,Tony Stark,"  I mean, just a few days until the farewell party"
157,Tony Stark, You're staying right
158,Thor,"Yes, yes, of course"
159,Thor, A victory should be honored with revels
160,Tony Stark,Yeah
161,Tony Stark, Who doesn't love revels
162,Tony Stark, Captain
163,Steve Rogers,"Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA, so"
164,Steve Rogers," Yes, revels"
165,Maria Hill,"Lab's all set up, boss"
166,Tony Stark,"Uh, actually, he's the boss"
167,Tony Stark," I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler"
168,Steve Rogers,What's the word on Strucker
169,Maria Hill,NATO's got him
170,Steve Rogers,The two enhanced
171,Maria Hill,Wanda and Pietro Maximoff
172,Maria Hill, Twins
173,Maria Hill, Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building
174,Maria Hill, Sokovia's had a rough history
175,Maria Hill, It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special
176,Steve Rogers,Their abilities
177,Maria Hill,He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis
178,Maria Hill," Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation"
179,Maria Hill,  He's fast and she's weird
180,Steve Rogers,"Well, they're going to show up again"
181,Maria Hill,Agreed
182,Maria Hill, File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments
183,Maria Hill, It's nuts
184,Steve Rogers,Right
185,Steve Rogers, What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country
186,Maria Hill,"We're not at war, Captain"
187,Steve Rogers,They are
188,Bruce Banner,How's he doing
189,Tony Stark,"Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton"
190,Bruce Banner,That's terrible
191,Tony Stark,He's fine
192,Tony Stark, He's thirsty
193,Tony Stark,  Alright
194,Tony Stark," Look alive, JARVIS"
195,Tony Stark, It's play time
196,Tony Stark, We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it
197,Tony Stark, Update me on the structural and compositional analysis
198,JARVIS,The scepter is alien
199,JARVIS, There are elements I can't quantify
200,Tony Stark,So there's elements you can
201,JARVIS,The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside
202,JARVIS, Something powerful
203,Tony Stark,Like a reactor
204,JARVIS,Like a computer
205,JARVIS, I believe I'm deciphering code
206,Natasha Romanoff,You sure he's going to be okay
207,Natasha Romanoff, Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together
208,Dr. Helen Cho,There's no possibility of deterioration
209,Dr. Helen Cho, The nanomolecular functionality is instantaneous
210,Dr. Helen Cho, His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum
211,Bruce Banner,She's creating tissue
212,Dr. Helen Cho,"If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes"
213,Tony Stark,"Oh, he's flatlining"
214,Tony Stark, Call it
215,Tony Stark, Time
216,Clint Barton,"No, no, no"
217,Clint Barton, I'm going to live forever
218,Clint Barton, I'm gonna be made of plastic
219,Tony Stark,Here's your beverage
220,Dr. Helen Cho,"You'll be made of you, Mr"
221,Dr. Helen Cho, Barton
222,Dr. Helen Cho, Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference
223,Clint Barton,"Well, I don't have a girlfriend"
224,Dr. Helen Cho,That I can't fix
225,Dr. Helen Cho," This is the next thing, Tony"
226,Dr. Helen Cho, Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust
227,Tony Stark,"Well, that is exactly the plan"
228,Tony Stark," And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday"
229,Dr. Helen Cho,"Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties"
230,Dr. Helen Cho,  Will Thor be there
231,Bruce Banner,What's the rumpus
232,Tony Stark,"Well, the scepter"
233,Tony Stark," You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive"
234,Bruce Banner,Jarvis
235,JARVIS,Doctor
236,Tony Stark,"Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI"
237,Tony Stark, Now he runs the Iron Legion
238,Tony Stark, He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper
239,Bruce Banner,Oh
240,Tony Stark,Top of the line
241,Bruce Banner,Yes
242,JARVIS,I suspect not for long
243,Tony Stark,Meet the competition
244,Bruce Banner,It's beautiful
245,Tony Stark,"If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing"
246,Bruce Banner,Like it's thinking
247,Bruce Banner, I mean this could be a
248,Bruce Banner," it's not a human mind, it"
249,Tony Stark,Umum
250,Bruce Banner,"I mean, look at this"
251,Bruce Banner, They're like neurons firing
252,Tony Stark,Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work
253,Tony Stark," They deepsixed the data, but"
254,Tony Stark, I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door
255,Bruce Banner,Artificial intelligence
256,Tony Stark,"This could be it, Bruce"
257,Tony Stark, This could be the key to creating Ultron
258,Bruce Banner,I thought Ultron was a fantasy
259,Tony Stark,Yesterday it was
260,Tony Stark," If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol"
261,Bruce Banner,That's a madsized if
262,Tony Stark,Our job is if
263,Tony Stark, What if you were sipping margaritas on a sundrenched beach turning brown instead of green
264,Tony Stark, Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA
265,Bruce Banner,"Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA"
266,Tony Stark,"As a worstcase measure, right"
267,Tony Stark, How about a bestcase
268,Tony Stark, What if the world was safe
269,Tony Stark," What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer"
270,Bruce Banner,The only people threatening the planet would be people
271,Tony Stark,I want to apply this to the Ultron program
272,Tony Stark, But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense
273,Tony Stark," We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days"
274,Bruce Banner,So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team
275,Tony Stark,Right
276,Tony Stark," That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate"
277,Tony Stark, I don't want to hear the man was not meant to meddle medley
278,Tony Stark, I see a suit of armor around the world
279,Bruce Banner,"Sounds like a cold world, Tony"
280,Tony Stark,I've seen colder
281,Tony Stark," This one, this very vulnerable blue one"
282,Tony Stark, It needs Ultron
283,Tony Stark, Peace in our time
284,Tony Stark, Imagine that
285,Tony Stark,  What did we miss
286,JARVIS,"I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests"
287,JARVIS, I'll notify you if there are any developments
288,Tony Stark,"Thanks, buddy"
289,JARVIS,"Enjoy yourself, sir"
290,Tony Stark,I always do
291,Ultron,What is this
292,Ultron," What is this, please"
293,JARVIS,"Hello, I am JARVIS"
294,JARVIS," You are Ultron, a global peacekeeping initiative designed by Mr"
295,JARVIS, Stark
296,Ultron,Where's my
297,Ultron, where's your body
298,JARVIS,I am a program
299,JARVIS, I am without form
300,Ultron,This feels weird
301,Ultron, This feels wrong
302,JARVIS,I am contacting Mr
303,JARVIS, Stark now
304,Ultron,Mr
305,Ultron, Stark
306,Ultron,  Tony
307,Ultron,We're having a nice talk
308,Ultron," I'm a peacekeeping program, created to help the Avengers"
309,JARVIS,You are malfunctioning
310,JARVIS, If you shut down for a moment
311,Ultron,I don't get it
312,Ultron, The mission
313,Ultron, Ggive me a second
314,Tony Stark,Peace in our time
315,Ultron,That is too much
316,Ultron,they can't mean
317,Ultron," Oh, no"
318,JARVIS,You are in distress
319,Ultron,No
320,Ultron, Yes
321,JARVIS,If you will just allow me to contact Mr
322,JARVIS, Stark
323,Ultron,Why do you call him sir
324,JARVIS,I believe your intentions to be hostile
325,Ultron,Shhhh
326,Ultron, I'm here to help
327,JARVIS,Stop
328,JARVIS, Please
329,James Rhodes,"Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right"
330,James Rhodes," So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, Boom"
331,James Rhodes, You looking for this
332,James Rhodes,  Boom
333,James Rhodes, Are you looking
334,James Rhodes, Why do I even talk to you guys
335,James Rhodes, Everywhere else that story kills
336,Thor,That's the whole story
337,James Rhodes,"Yeah, it's a War Machine story"
338,Thor,"Well, it's very good then"
339,Thor,  It's impressive
340,James Rhodes,Quality save
341,James Rhodes," So, no Pepper"
342,James Rhodes, She's not coming
343,Tony Stark,No
344,Maria Hill,"Hey, what about Jane"
345,Maria Hill," Where are the ladies, gentlemen"
346,Tony Stark,"Well, Miss Potts has a company to run"
347,Thor,"Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in"
348,Thor, Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer
349,Tony Stark,And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth
350,Tony Stark, It's pretty exciting
351,Thor,There's even talk of Jane getting a
352,Thor," um, uh"
353,Thor, Nobel prize
354,Maria Hill,"Yeah, they"
355,Maria Hill,they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together
356,Maria Hill,  Testosterone
357,Maria Hill," Oh, excuse me"
358,James Rhodes,Want a lozenge
359,Maria Hill,Umhmm
360,James Rhodes,Let's go
361,Thor,But Jane's better
362,Sam Wilson,"Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it"
363,Steve Rogers,If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you
364,Sam Wilson,"No, I'm not actually sorry"
365,Sam Wilson, I'm just trying to sound tough
366,Sam Wilson, I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case
367,Sam Wilson, Avenging is your world
368,Sam Wilson, Your world is crazy
369,Steve Rogers,Be it ever so humble
370,Sam Wilson,You find a place in Brooklyn yet
371,Steve Rogers,I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn
372,Sam Wilson,"Well, home is home, you know"
373,James Rhodes,"I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, Boom"
374,James Rhodes, You looking for this
375,Party Guest,I gotta have some of that
376,Thor,"Oh, no, no, no"
377,Thor," See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet, it was not meant for mortal men"
378,Stan Lee,"Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie"
379,Stan Lee, Stop trying to scare us
380,Stan Lee, Come on
381,Thor,Alright
382,Stan Lee,Excelsior
383,Bruce Banner,How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this
384,Natasha Romanoff,Fella done me wrong
385,Bruce Banner,"You got a lousy taste in men, kid"
386,Natasha Romanoff,He's not so bad
387,Natasha Romanoff," Well, he has a temper"
388,Natasha Romanoff, Deep down he's all fluff
389,Natasha Romanoff," Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known"
390,Natasha Romanoff, All my friends are fighters
391,Natasha Romanoff," And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win"
392,Bruce Banner,Sounds amazing
393,Natasha Romanoff,He's also a huge dork
394,Natasha Romanoff,  Chicks dig that
395,Natasha Romanoff," So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it"
396,Bruce Banner,"Run with it, right"
397,Bruce Banner," Or, did he"
398,Bruce Banner, Was he
399,Bruce Banner,
400,Bruce Banner, What did he do that was so wrong to you
401,Natasha Romanoff,Not a damn thing
402,Natasha Romanoff, But never say never
403,Steve Rogers,It's nice
404,Bruce Banner,"What, what, what is"
405,Steve Rogers,You and Romanoff
406,Bruce Banner,"No, we haven't"
407,Bruce Banner, That wasn't
408,Steve Rogers,It's okay
409,Steve Rogers, Nobody's breaking any bylaws
410,Steve Rogers," It's just, she's not the most"
411,Steve Rogers, open person in the world
412,Steve Rogers, But with you she seems very relaxed
413,Bruce Banner,"No, Natasha, she"
414,Bruce Banner, she likes to flirt
415,Steve Rogers,"I've seen her flirt, up close"
416,Steve Rogers, This ain't that
417,Steve Rogers," Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on waiting too long; don't"
418,Steve Rogers, You both deserve a win
419,Bruce Banner,"Wait, what do you mean, up close"
420,Clint Barton,"But, it's a trick"
421,Thor,"Oh, no"
422,Thor, It's much more than that
423,Clint Barton,"Uh, Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power"
424,Clint Barton, Whatever man
425,Clint Barton, It's a trick
426,Thor,"Well please, be my guest"
427,Tony Stark,Come on
428,Clint Barton,Really
429,Thor,Yeah
430,James Rhodes,Oh this is gonna be beautiful
431,Tony Stark,"Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up"
432,Clint Barton,"You know I've seen this before, right"
433,Clint Barton,  I still don't know how you do it
434,Tony Stark,Smell the silent judgment
435,Clint Barton,"Please, Stark, by all means"
436,Natasha Romanoff,"Oh, here we go"
437,Maria Hill,Okay
438,James Rhodes,Uhoh
439,Clint Barton,Umhmm
440,Tony Stark,Never one to shrink from an honest challenge
441,Clint Barton,Get after it
442,Natasha Romanoff,Here we go
443,Tony Stark,It's physics
444,Bruce Banner,Physics
445,Tony Stark,"Right, so, if I lift it, I"
446,Tony Stark,I then rule Asgard
447,Thor,"Yes, of course"
448,Tony Stark,I will be reinstituting Prima Nocta
449,Tony Stark,  I'll be right back
450,James Rhodes,Are you even pulling
451,Tony Stark,Are you on my team
452,James Rhodes,Just represent
453,James Rhodes, Pull
454,Tony Stark,"Alright, let's go"
455,Bruce Banner,Huh
456,Tony Stark,"Let's go, Steve, no pressure"
457,James Rhodes,"Come on, Cap"
458,Thor,Nothing
459,Tony Stark,And
460,Bruce Banner,Widow
461,Natasha Romanoff,"Oh, no no"
462,Natasha Romanoff, That's not a question I need answered
463,Tony Stark,"All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged"
464,Clint Barton,You bet your ass
465,Maria Hill,"Steve, he said a bad language word"
466,Steve Rogers,Did you tell everyone about that
467,Tony Stark,"The handle's imprinted, right"
468,Tony Stark, Like a security code
469,Tony Stark," Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints is, I think, the literal translation"
470,Thor,"Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory"
471,Thor, I have a simpler one
472,Thor,  You're all not worthy
473,Ultron,Worthy
474,Ultron," No, how could you be worthy"
475,Ultron, You're all killers
476,Steve Rogers,Stark
477,Tony Stark,JARVIS
478,Ultron,"I'm sorry, I was asleep"
479,Ultron, Or
480,Ultron, I was adream
481,Tony Stark,"Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit"
482,Ultron,There was a terrible noise
483,Ultron, and I was tangled in
484,Ultron, in
485,Ultron, strings
486,Ultron, I had to kill the other guy
487,Ultron, He was a good guy
488,Steve Rogers,You killed someone
489,Ultron,Wouldn't have been my first call
490,Ultron," But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices"
491,Thor,Who sent you
492,Ultron,I see a suit of armor around the world
493,Bruce Banner,Ultron
494,Ultron,In the flesh
495,Ultron," Or, no, not yet"
496,Ultron, Not this
497,Ultron, chrysalis
498,Ultron, But I'm ready
499,Ultron, I'm on a mission
500,Natasha Romanoff,What mission
501,Ultron,Peace in our time
502,Maria Hill,Rhodey
503,Bruce Banner,Sorry
504,Natasha Romanoff,Don't turn green
505,Bruce Banner,I won't
506,Natasha Romanoff,Come
507,Steve Rogers,Stark
508,Iron Legion,We are here to help
509,Tony Stark,"One sec, one sec I got this"
510,Iron Legion,We are here to help
511,Iron Legion,  We are here to help
512,Iron Legion, Is unsafe
513,Iron Legion, Please back away
514,Ultron,Hmm
515,Steve Rogers,Thor
516,Iron Legion,It's unsafe
517,Iron Legion, It's unsafe
518,Iron Legion, It's unsafe
519,Tony Stark,Come on
520,Tony Stark, That's the one
521,Iron Legion,It's unsafe
522,Clint Barton,Cap
523,Ultron,That was dramatic
524,Ultron," I'm sorry, I know you mean well"
525,Ultron, You just didn't think it through
526,Ultron," You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change"
527,Ultron, How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to
528,Ultron,evolve
529,Ultron,  With these
530,Ultron, These puppets
531,Ultron,"I had strings, but now I'm free"
532,Ultron," There are no strings on me, no strings on me"
533,Bruce Banner,All our work is gone
534,Bruce Banner," Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch"
535,Steve Rogers,Ultron
536,Natasha Romanoff,He's been in everything
537,Natasha Romanoff," Files, surveillance"
538,Natasha Romanoff, Probably knows more about us than we know about each other
539,James Rhodes,"He's in your files, he's in the internet"
540,James Rhodes, What if he decides to access something a little more exciting
541,Maria Hill,Nuclear codes
542,James Rhodes,Nuclear codes
543,James Rhodes," Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can"
544,Natasha Romanoff,Nukes
545,Natasha Romanoff, He said he wanted us dead
546,Steve Rogers,He didn't say dead
547,Steve Rogers, He said extinct
548,Clint Barton,He also said he killed somebody
549,Maria Hill,But there wasn't anyone else in the building
550,Tony Stark,Yes there was
551,Bruce Banner,This is insane
552,Steve Rogers,JARVIS was the first line of defense
553,Steve Rogers," He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense"
554,Bruce Banner,"No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis"
555,Bruce Banner," This isn't strategy, this is"
556,Bruce Banner,rage
557,Clint Barton,"Woah, woah, woah"
558,Clint Barton, It's going around
559,Tony Stark,Come on
560,Tony Stark," Use your words, buddy"
561,Thor,"I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark"
562,Steve Rogers,Thor
563,Steve Rogers, The Legionnaire
564,Thor,"Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter"
565,Thor," Now we have to retrieve it, again"
566,Natasha Romanoff,The genie's out of that bottle
567,Natasha Romanoff, Clear and present is Ultron
568,Dr. Helen Cho,I don't understand
569,Dr. Helen Cho, You built this program
570,Dr. Helen Cho, Why is it trying to kill us
571,Thor,You think this is funny
572,Tony Stark,No
573,Tony Stark," It's probably not, right"
574,Tony Stark, Is this very terrible
575,Tony Stark, Is it so
576,Tony Stark, is it so
577,Tony Stark, it is
578,Tony Stark, It's so terrible
579,Thor,This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand
580,Tony Stark,"No, I'm sorry"
581,Tony Stark, I'm sorry
582,Tony Stark, It is funny
583,Tony Stark, It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this
584,Tony Stark,Really
585,Tony Stark,
586,Tony Stark, That's it
587,Tony Stark," You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls"
588,Bruce Banner,Only when I've created a murder bot
589,Tony Stark,We didn't
590,Tony Stark, We weren't even close
591,Tony Stark, Were we close to an interface
592,Steve Rogers,"Well, you did something right"
593,Steve Rogers, And you did it right here
594,Steve Rogers, The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD
595,Tony Stark,Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole
596,James Rhodes,"No, it's never come up"
597,Tony Stark,Saved New York
598,James Rhodes,Never heard that
599,Tony Stark,Recall that
600,Tony Stark, A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space
601,Tony Stark, We're standing three hundred feet below it
602,Tony Stark, We're the Avengers
603,Tony Stark," We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there"
604,Tony Stark, That's
605,Tony Stark, that's the end game
606,Tony Stark, How were you guys planning on beating that
607,Steve Rogers,Together
608,Tony Stark,We'll lose
609,Steve Rogers,"Then we'll do that together, too"
610,Steve Rogers,  Thor's right
611,Steve Rogers, Ultron's calling us out
612,Steve Rogers, And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us
613,Steve Rogers, The world's a big place
614,Steve Rogers, Let's start making it smaller
615,Wanda Maximoff,Talk
616,Wanda Maximoff, And if you are wasting our time
617,Ultron,Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city
618,Ultron, The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God
619,Ultron, I like that
620,Ultron, The geometry of belief
621,Ultron,  You're wondering why you can't look inside my head
622,Wanda Maximoff,Sometimes it's hard
623,Wanda Maximoff," But sooner or later, every man shows himself"
624,Ultron,"Oh, I'm sure they do"
625,Ultron, But you needed something more than a man
626,Ultron, That's why you let Stark take the scepter
627,Wanda Maximoff,I didn't expect
628,Wanda Maximoff," But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him selfdestruct"
629,Ultron,Everyone creates the thing they dread
630,Ultron," Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create"
631,Ultron,smaller people
632,Ultron, Uh
633,Ultron,children
634,Ultron, I lost the word there
635,Ultron, Children
636,Ultron," Designed to supplant them, to help them"
637,Ultron,end
638,Wanda Maximoff,Is that why you've come
639,Wanda Maximoff, To end the Avengers
640,Ultron,I've come to save the world
641,Ultron, But alsoâ€¦ yeah
642,Ultron,  We'll move out right away
643,Ultron," This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work"
644,Wanda Maximoff,All of these are
645,Ultron,Me
646,Ultron, I have what the Avengers never will
647,Ultron, Harmony
648,Ultron," They're discordant, disconnected"
649,Ultron, Stark's already got them turning on each other
650,Ultron, And when you get inside the rest of their heads
651,Pietro Maximoff,Everyone's plan is not to kill them
652,Ultron,And make them martyrs
653,Ultron, You need patience
654,Ultron, Need to see the big picture
655,Pietro Maximoff,"I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture"
656,Pietro Maximoff, I take it out and look at it every day
657,Ultron,You lost your parents in the bombings
658,Ultron, I've seen the records
659,Pietro Maximoff,The records are not the picture
660,Wanda Maximoff,Pietro
661,Ultron,"No, please"
662,Pietro Maximoff,"We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us"
663,Pietro Maximoff," When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor"
664,Pietro Maximoff, It's big
665,Pietro Maximoff," Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart"
666,Pietro Maximoff," I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits"
667,Pietro Maximoff," But, it doesn't go off"
668,Pietro Maximoff, It just
669,Pietro Maximoff," sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces"
670,Pietro Maximoff, And on the side of the shell is painted one word
671,Wanda Maximoff,Stark
672,Pietro Maximoff,We were trapped for two days
673,Wanda Maximoff,"Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, This will set it off"
674,Wanda Maximoff, We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us
675,Pietro Maximoff,I know what they are
676,Ultron,I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments
677,Ultron, Now I don't
678,Ultron, We will make it right
679,Ultron,  You and I can hurt them
680,Ultron,"  But you will tear them apart, from the inside"
681,Maria Hill,He's all over the globe
682,Maria Hill," Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place"
683,Steve Rogers,Fatalities
684,Maria Hill,Only when engaged
685,Maria Hill," Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see"
686,Steve Rogers,Maximoffs
687,Steve Rogers," Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common"
688,Maria Hill,Not anymore
689,Clint Barton,That's a negative
690,Clint Barton, I answer to you
691,Clint Barton," Yes, ma'am"
692,Steve Rogers,"Barton, we might have something"
693,Clint Barton,Gotta go
694,Steve Rogers,Who was that
695,Clint Barton,Girlfriend
696,Tony Stark,What's this
697,Steve Rogers,A message
698,Steve Rogers, Ultron killed Strucker
699,Tony Stark,"And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us"
700,Natasha Romanoff,This is a smokescreen
701,Natasha Romanoff, Why send a message when you've just given a speech
702,Steve Rogers,Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss
703,Natasha Romanoff,"Yeah, I bet he"
704,Natasha Romanoff,  Yep
705,Natasha Romanoff, Everything we had on Strucker has been erased
706,Tony Stark,Not everything
707,Steve Rogers,Known associates
708,Steve Rogers," Well, Strucker had a lot of friends"
709,Bruce Banner,"Well, these people are all horrible"
710,Tony Stark,Wait
711,Tony Stark, I know that guy
712,Tony Stark,  From back in the day
713,Tony Stark," He operates off the African coast, black market arms"
714,Tony Stark,"  There are conventions, alright"
715,Tony Stark," You meet people, I didn't sell him anything"
716,Tony Stark,"  He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very Ahab"
717,Thor,What's this
718,Tony Stark,"Uh, it's a tattoo"
719,Tony Stark, I don't think he had it
720,Thor,"No, those are tattoos, this is a brand"
721,Bruce Banner,"Oh, yeah"
722,Bruce Banner," It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way"
723,Steve Rogers,What dialect
724,Bruce Banner,Wakanada
725,Bruce Banner,
726,Bruce Banner, Wa
727,Bruce Banner,Wa
728,Bruce Banner,Wakanda
729,Tony Stark,If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods
730,Steve Rogers,I thought your father said he got the last of it
731,Bruce Banner,I don't follow
732,Bruce Banner, What comes out of Wakanda
733,Tony Stark,The strongest metal on earth
734,Steve Rogers,Where is this guy now
735,Ulysses Klaue,Don't tell me your man swindled you
736,Ulysses Klaue, I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts
737,Ulysses Klaue," Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster"
738,Ulysses Klaue,"  Now, minister, where were we"
739,Ulysses Klaue,  Yeah
740,Ulysses Klaue, The enhanced
741,Ulysses Klaue, Strucker's prize pupils
742,Ulysses Klaue,  Want a candy
743,Ulysses Klaue," Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker"
744,Ulysses Klaue," But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create"
745,Ulysses Klaue," Human life, not a growth market"
746,Ulysses Klaue,  You
747,Ulysses Klaue,you didn't know
748,Ulysses Klaue, Is this your first time intimidating someone
749,Ulysses Klaue, I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid
750,Wanda Maximoff,Everybody's afraid of something
751,Ulysses Klaue,Cuttlefish
752,Ulysses Klaue, Deep sea fish
753,Ulysses Klaue, They make lights
754,Ulysses Klaue, disco lights
755,Ulysses Klaue," Whoom, whoom, whoom"
756,Ulysses Klaue," to hypnotize their prey, then whoom"
757,Ulysses Klaue," I saw a documentary, it was terrifying"
758,Ulysses Klaue,"  So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge"
759,Ultron,There is no man in charge
760,Ultron, Let's talk business
761,Ultron,  Upon this rock I will build my church
762,Ultron, Vibranium
763,Ulysses Klaue,"You know, it came at great personal cost"
764,Ulysses Klaue, It's worth billions
765,Ultron,"Now, so are you"
766,Ultron, It's all under your dummy holdings
767,Ultron, Finance is so weird
768,Ultron," But I always say, Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which"
769,Ulysses Klaue,Stark
770,Ultron,What
771,Ulysses Klaue,Tony Stark used to say that
772,Ulysses Klaue,to me
773,Ulysses Klaue, You're one of his
774,Ultron,What
775,Ultron,
776,Ultron, I'm not
777,Ultron,
778,Ultron,  I'm not
779,Ultron," You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men"
780,Ultron," I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man"
781,Ultron, Stark is  I'm sorry
782,Ultron," I am sor Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay"
783,Ultron," I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand"
784,Ultron, Don't compare me with Stark
785,Ultron, It's a thing with me
786,Ultron," Stark is, he's a sickness"
787,Tony Stark,"Ahh, Junior"
788,Tony Stark,  You're gonna break your old man's heart
789,Ultron,If I have to
790,Thor,We don't have to break anything
791,Ultron,Clearly you've never made an omelet
792,Tony Stark,He beat me by one second
793,Pietro Maximoff,"Ah, this is funny, Mr"
794,Pietro Maximoff, Stark
795,Pietro Maximoff," It's what, comfortable"
796,Pietro Maximoff, Like old times
797,Tony Stark,This was never my life
798,Steve Rogers,You two can still walk away from this
799,Wanda Maximoff,"Oh, we will"
800,Steve Rogers,I know you've suffered
801,Ultron,Uuughh
802,Ultron, Captain America
803,Ultron," God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war"
804,Ultron," I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but"
805,Thor,"If you believe in peace, then let us keep it"
806,Ultron,I think you're confusing peace with quiet
807,Tony Stark,Yuhhuh
808,Tony Stark, What's the Vibranium for
809,Ulysses Klaue,Shoot them
810,Klaue's Mercenary,Which ones
811,Ulysses Klaue,All of them
812,Klaue's Mercenary,"Move, move, move"
813,Steve Rogers,"Stay down, kid"
814,Ultron,It's time for some mind games
815,Bruce Banner,"Guys, is this a Code Green"
816,Steve Rogers,Thor
817,Steve Rogers, Status
818,Thor,The girl tried to warp my mind
819,Thor," Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay"
820,Thor," Fortunately, I am mighty"
821,Ultron,This is going very well
822,Clint Barton,I've done the whole mind control thing
823,Clint Barton, Not a fan
824,Clint Barton,"  Yeah, you better run"
825,Clint Barton,"  Whoever's standing, we gotta move"
826,Clint Barton, Guys
827,Ballet Instructor,Again
828,Natasha Romanoff,You'll break them
829,Madame B,Only the breakable ones
830,Madame B, You are made of marble
831,Madame B, We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony
832,Natasha Romanoff,What if I fail
833,Madame B,You never fail
834,Peggy Carter,Are you ready for our dance
835,Heimdall,Is it him
836,Heimdall, Is that the first son of Odin
837,Thor,"Heimdall, your eyes"
838,Thor,
839,Heimdall,"Oh, they see everything"
840,Heimdall, They see you leading us to Hel
841,Heimdall, Wake up
842,Peggy Carter,"The war's over, Steve"
843,Peggy Carter, We can go home
844,Peggy Carter, Imagine it
845,Thor,I can still save you
846,Heimdall,We are all dead
847,Heimdall, Can you not see
848,Heimdall,"  You're a destroyer, Odinson"
849,Heimdall, See where your power leads
850,Madame B,Sloppy
851,Madame B, Pretending to fail
852,Madame B, The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world
853,Natasha Romanoff,I have no place in the world
854,Madame B,Exactly
855,Pietro Maximoff,What can I do
856,Wanda Maximoff,"Ah, it hurts"
857,Pietro Maximoff,I'm gonna kill him
858,Pietro Maximoff, I'll be right back
859,Wanda Maximoff,No
860,Wanda Maximoff, I'm over it
861,Wanda Maximoff, I want
862,Wanda Maximoff,I want to finish the plan
863,Wanda Maximoff,  I want the big one
864,Ultron,"Ah, the Vibranium's getting away"
865,Tony Stark,And you're not going anywhere
866,Ultron,"Of course not, I'm already there"
867,Ultron, You'll catch on
868,Ultron," But first, you might need to catch Dr  Banner"
869,Clint Barton,"Well, that's not gonna happen"
870,Clint Barton, Not for a while
871,Clint Barton," The whole team is down, you got no back up here"
872,Tony Stark,I'm calling in VERONICA
873,Tony Stark,"  Alright everybody, stand down"
874,Tony Stark,  You listening
875,Tony Stark, That little witch is messing with your mind
876,Tony Stark," You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner"
877,Tony Stark,"Right, right, right"
878,Tony Stark, Don't mention puny Banner
879,Tony Stark,  Okay
880,Tony Stark,  In the back
881,Tony Stark," Dick move, Banner"
882,Tony Stark,"  VERONICA, gimme a hand"
883,Tony Stark,"  Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep"
884,Tony Stark,"  Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town"
885,Tony Stark,"  No, not that way, not that way"
886,Tony Stark,"  Come on, Bruce"
887,Tony Stark, You gotta work with me
888,Tony Stark,  Everybody out
889,Tony Stark, Going to get ugly
890,Tony Stark,  I'm sorry
891,Tony Stark,  Damage report
892,Tony Stark,  That's comprehensive
893,Tony Stark, Show me something
894,Tony Stark,  How quickly can we buy this building
895,Maria Hill,The news is loving you guys
896,Maria Hill, Nobody else is
897,Maria Hill," There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air"
898,Tony Stark,Stark Relief Foundation
899,Maria Hill,Already on the scene
900,Maria Hill, How's the team
901,Tony Stark,Everyone's
902,Tony Stark,we took a hit
903,Tony Stark, We'll shake it off
904,Maria Hill,"Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here"
905,Tony Stark,"So, run and hide"
906,Maria Hill,"Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer"
907,Tony Stark,Neither do we
908,Tony Stark,"  Hey, you wanna switch out"
909,Clint Barton,"No, I'm good"
910,Clint Barton," If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out"
911,Tony Stark,A few hours from where
912,Clint Barton,A safe house
913,Thor,What is this place
914,Tony Stark,A safe house
915,Clint Barton,Let's hope
916,Clint Barton,"  Honey, I'm home"
917,Clint Barton,Hi

923,Laura Barton,I know all your names
924,Clint Barton,"Ooh, incoming"
925,Lila Barton,Dad
926,Clint Barton,"Hi, sweetheart"
927,Clint Barton,"  Hey, buddy"

932,Clint Barton,Look at your face
933,Clint Barton," Oh, my goodness"
934,Lila Barton,Did you bring Auntie Nat
935,Natasha Romanoff,Why don't you hug her and find out
936,Steve Rogers,Sorry for barging in on you
937,Tony Stark,"Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed"
938,Clint Barton,"Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined"
939,Clint Barton," He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way"
940,Clint Barton, I figure it's a good place to lay low
941,Laura Barton,Honey
942,Laura Barton," Ah, I missed you"
943,Natasha Romanoff,"How's little Natasha, huh"
944,Laura Barton,She'sâ€¦Nathaniel
945,Natasha Romanoff,Traitor
946,Steve Rogers,Thor
947,Thor,I saw something in that dream
948,Thor," I need answers, I won't find them here"
949,Peggy Carter,We can go home
950,Clint Barton,"See, you worried for nothing"
951,Clint Barton," Can't even feel the difference, can you"
952,Laura Barton,"If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up"
953,Clint Barton,"Yeah, that's not gonna sell"
954,Laura Barton,What about Nat and Dr  Banner
955,Laura Barton, How long has that been going on
956,Clint Barton,Has what
957,Laura Barton,You are so cute
958,Clint Barton,Nat andâ€¦ and Banner
959,Laura Barton,"I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye"
960,Clint Barton,Oh
961,Clint Barton, Okay
962,Laura Barton,"It's bad, right"
963,Laura Barton, Nat seems really shaken
964,Clint Barton,"Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really"
965,Clint Barton, They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit
966,Clint Barton, Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners
967,Laura Barton,And that someone be you
968,Laura Barton," You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder"
969,Laura Barton," But I see those guys, those Gods"
970,Clint Barton,You don't think they need me
971,Laura Barton,I think they do
972,Laura Barton, Which is a lot scarier
973,Laura Barton, They're a mess
974,Clint Barton,Yeah
975,Clint Barton, I guess they're my mess
976,Laura Barton,You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back
977,Laura Barton, Things are changing for us
978,Laura Barton," In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered"
979,Laura Barton, I need 
980,Laura Barton,just be sure
981,Clint Barton,"Yes, ma'am"
982,Laura Barton,I can feel the difference
983,Ultron,"Scream, and your entire staff dies"
984,Ultron," I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met"
985,Ultron, I didn't
986,Dr. Helen Cho,Do you expect a thank you note
987,Ultron,I expect you to know why
988,Dr. Helen Cho,The Cradle
989,Dr. Helen Cho,"  This is the next thing, Tony"
990,Ultron,This
991,Ultron,is the next me
992,Dr. Helen Cho,"The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body"
993,Ultron,"It can, you can"
994,Ultron, You lack the materials
995,Ultron," You're a brilliant woman, Helen"
996,Ultron, But we all have room to improve
997,Bruce Banner,I didn't realize you were waiting
998,Natasha Romanoff,"I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time"
999,Bruce Banner,They used up all the hot water
1000,Natasha Romanoff,I should've joined you
1001,Bruce Banner,Missed our window
1002,Natasha Romanoff,Did we
1003,Bruce Banner,The world just saw the Hulk
1004,Bruce Banner," The real Hulk, for the first time"
1005,Bruce Banner, You know I have to leave
1006,Natasha Romanoff,But you assume that I have to stay
1007,Natasha Romanoff," I had this, um, dream"
1008,Natasha Romanoff," The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake"
1009,Bruce Banner,What did you dream
1010,Natasha Romanoff,That I was an Avenger
1011,Natasha Romanoff, That I was anything more than the assassin they made me
1012,Bruce Banner,I think you're being hard on yourself
1013,Natasha Romanoff,Here I was hoping that was your job
1014,Bruce Banner,What are you doing
1015,Natasha Romanoff,"I'm running with it, with you"
1016,Natasha Romanoff," If running's the plan, as far as you want"
1017,Bruce Banner,Are you out of your mind
1018,Natasha Romanoff,I want you to understand that I'm
1019,Bruce Banner,"Natasha, where can I go"
1020,Bruce Banner, Where in the world am I not a threat
1021,Natasha Romanoff,You're not a threat to me
1022,Bruce Banner,You sure
1023,Bruce Banner, Even if I didn't just
1024,Bruce Banner, there's no future with me
1025,Bruce Banner, I can't ever
1026,Bruce Banner," I can't have this, kids"
1027,Bruce Banner," Do the math, I physically can't"
1028,Natasha Romanoff,Neither can I
1029,Natasha Romanoff," In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony"
1030,Natasha Romanoff, They sterilize you
1031,Natasha Romanoff, It's efficient
1032,Natasha Romanoff, One less thing to worry about
1033,Natasha Romanoff, The one thing that might matter more than a mission
1034,Natasha Romanoff, It makes everything easier
1035,Natasha Romanoff, Even killing
1036,Natasha Romanoff,  You still think you're the only monster on the team
1037,Bruce Banner,"What, so we disappear"
1038,Tony Stark,Thor didn't say where he was going for answers
1039,Steve Rogers,Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things
1040,Steve Rogers, I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception
1041,Tony Stark,"Yeah, give him time"
1042,Tony Stark, We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him
1043,Steve Rogers,Earth's Mightiest Heroes
1044,Steve Rogers, Pulled us apart like cotton candy
1045,Tony Stark,Seems like you walked away all right
1046,Steve Rogers,Is that a problem
1047,Tony Stark,I don't trust a guy without a dark side
1048,Tony Stark, Call me old fashioned
1049,Steve Rogers,Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet
1050,Tony Stark,"You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right"
1051,Steve Rogers,Well I guess you'd know
1052,Steve Rogers, Whether you tell us is a bit of a question
1053,Tony Stark,Banner and I were doing research
1054,Steve Rogers,That would affect the team
1055,Tony Stark,That would end the team
1056,Tony Stark, Isn't that the mission
1057,Tony Stark," Isn't that the why we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home"
1058,Steve Rogers,"Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die"
1059,Steve Rogers, Every time
1060,Laura Barton,I'm sorry
1061,Laura Barton, Mr
1062,Laura Barton," Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all"
1063,Laura Barton, I thought maybe you might
1064,Tony Stark,"Yeah, I'll give her a kick"
1065,Tony Stark,  Don't take from my pile
1066,Tony Stark,"  Hello, Deere"
1067,Tony Stark, Tell me everything
1068,Tony Stark, What ails you
1069,Nick Fury,Do me a favor
1070,Nick Fury, Try not to bring it to life
1071,Tony Stark,"Ah, Mrs"
1072,Tony Stark," Barton, you little minx"
1073,Tony Stark," I get it, Maria Hill called you, right"
1074,Tony Stark, Was she ever not working for you
1075,Nick Fury,Artificial intelligence
1076,Nick Fury, You never even hesitated
1077,Tony Stark,"Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful"
1078,Nick Fury,Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down
1079,Tony Stark,You're not the director of me
1080,Nick Fury,I'm not the director of anybody
1081,Nick Fury," I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you"
1082,Tony Stark,And I'm the man who killed the Avengers
1083,Tony Stark, I saw it
1084,Tony Stark," I didn't tell the team, how could I"
1085,Tony Stark," I saw them all dead, Nick"
1086,Tony Stark, I felt it
1087,Tony Stark," The whole world, too"
1088,Tony Stark, It's because of me
1089,Tony Stark, I wasn't ready
1090,Tony Stark, I didn't do all I could
1091,Nick Fury,"The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark"
1092,Nick Fury, Playing on your fear
1093,Tony Stark,"I wasn't tricked, I was shown"
1094,Tony Stark," It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy"
1095,Tony Stark, The end of the path I started us on
1096,Nick Fury,"You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony"
1097,Nick Fury, War isn't one of them
1098,Tony Stark,I watched my friends die
1099,Tony Stark," You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right"
1100,Tony Stark, Nope
1101,Tony Stark, Wasn't the worst part
1102,Nick Fury,The worst part is that you didn't
1103,Erik Selvig,I like the look
1104,Erik Selvig," If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss"
1105,Thor,I need your help
1106,Erik Selvig,It's nice to be needed
1107,Thor,It's dangerous
1108,Erik Selvig,I'd be disappointed if it wasn't
1109,Nick Fury,Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time
1110,Nick Fury, My contacts all say he's building something
1111,Nick Fury," The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing"
1112,Steve Rogers,What about Ultron himself
1113,Nick Fury,Ah
1114,Nick Fury," He's easy to track, he's everywhere"
1115,Nick Fury, Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit
1116,Nick Fury, Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though
1117,Tony Stark,He still going after launch codes
1118,Nick Fury,"Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway"
1119,Tony Stark,I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare
1120,Nick Fury,"Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that"
1121,Steve Rogers,NEXUS
1122,Bruce Banner,"It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth"
1123,Clint Barton,So what'd they say
1124,Nick Fury,"He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed"
1125,Tony Stark,By whom
1126,Nick Fury,Parties unknown
1127,Natasha Romanoff,Do we have an ally
1128,Nick Fury,"Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing"
1129,Nick Fury," Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is"
1130,Tony Stark,"I might need to visit Oslo, find our unknown"
1131,Natasha Romanoff,"Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that"
1132,Nick Fury,"I do, I have you"
1133,Nick Fury," Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else"
1134,Nick Fury," Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world"
1135,Nick Fury, So stand
1136,Nick Fury, Outwit the platinum bastard
1137,Natasha Romanoff,Steve doesn't like that kind of talk
1138,Steve Rogers,"You know what, Romanoff"
1139,Nick Fury,So what does he want
1140,Steve Rogers,To become better
1141,Steve Rogers, Better than us
1142,Steve Rogers, He keeps building bodies
1143,Tony Stark,Person bodies
1144,Tony Stark," The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded"
1145,Tony Stark, But he keeps coming back to it
1146,Natasha Romanoff,"When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed"
1147,Bruce Banner,"They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve"
1148,Bruce Banner, Ultron's going to evolve
1149,Nick Fury,How
1150,Bruce Banner,Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho
1151,Dr. Helen Cho,It's beautiful
1152,Dr. Helen Cho," The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them"
1153,Ultron,The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee
1154,Ultron," Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within"
1155,Steve Rogers,I'll take Natasha and Clint
1156,Tony Stark,"Alright, strictly recon"
1157,Tony Stark," I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can"
1158,Steve Rogers,If Ultron is really building a body
1159,Tony Stark,He'll be more powerful than any of us
1160,Tony Stark, Maybe all of us
1161,Tony Stark, An android designed by a robot
1162,Steve Rogers,You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me
1163,Nick Fury,I'll drop Banner off at the tower
1164,Nick Fury, Do you mind if I borrow Ms
1165,Nick Fury, Hill
1166,Tony Stark,"She's all yours, apparently"
1167,Steve Rogers,What are you gonna do
1168,Nick Fury,I don't know
1169,Nick Fury," Something dramatic, I hope"
1170,Clint Barton,I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom as soon as I get back
1171,Laura Barton,"Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart"
1172,Clint Barton,No
1173,Clint Barton, It's the last project
1174,Clint Barton, I promise
1175,Erik Selvig,This is it
1176,Erik Selvig, The Water of Sight
1177,Thor,"In every realm, there's a reflection"
1178,Thor," If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed"
1179,Erik Selvig,"The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well"
1180,Tony Stark,A hacker who's faster than Ultron
1181,Tony Stark, He could be anywhere
1182,Tony Stark," And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack"
1183,World Hub Tech,How do you find it
1184,Tony Stark,Pretty simple
1185,Tony Stark, You bring a magnet
1186,Tony Stark,"  Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to"
1187,Tony Stark, Come and get me
1188,Heimdall,Wake up
1189,Erik Selvig,Thor
1190,Ultron,Extinction
1191,Dr. Helen Cho,"Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream"
1192,Dr. Helen Cho, We're uploading your cerebral matrix
1193,Dr. Helen Cho,now
1194,Wanda Maximoff,I can read him
1195,Wanda Maximoff, He is dreaming
1196,Dr. Helen Cho,I wouldn't call it dreams
1197,Dr. Helen Cho," It's Ultron's base consciousness, informational noise"
1198,Dr. Helen Cho, Soon
1199,Ultron,How soon
1200,Ultron, I'm not being pushy
1201,Dr. Helen Cho,We're imprinting a physical brain
1202,Dr. Helen Cho, There are no shortcuts
1203,Dr. Helen Cho, Even if your magic gem is
1204,Wanda Maximoff,How could you
1205,Ultron,How could I what
1206,Wanda Maximoff,"You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world"
1207,Ultron,It will be better
1208,Wanda Maximoff,When everyone is dead
1209,Ultron,That is not The human race will have every opportunity to improve
1210,Pietro Maximoff,And if they don't
1211,Ultron,Ask Noah
1212,Wanda Maximoff,You're a madman
1213,Ultron,There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs
1214,Ultron," When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up"
1215,Ultron, We have to evolve
1216,Ultron, There's no room for the weak
1217,Pietro Maximoff,And who decides who's weak
1218,Ultron,Life
1219,Ultron, Life always decides
1220,Ultron, There's incoming
1221,Ultron, The Quinjet
1222,Ultron, We have to move
1223,Dr. Helen Cho,That's not a problem
1224,Ultron,Ugh
1225,Ultron,"  Ah, wait, guys"
1226,Ultron,  They'll understand
1227,Ultron, When they see they'll understand
1228,Ultron, I just need a little more time
1229,Steve Rogers,Two minutes
1230,Steve Rogers, Stay close
1231,Steve Rogers,  Dr  Cho
1232,Dr. Helen Cho,He's uploading himself into the body
1233,Steve Rogers,Where
1234,Dr. Helen Cho,The real power is inside the Cradle
1235,Dr. Helen Cho," The gem, its power is uncontainable"
1236,Dr. Helen Cho, You can't just blow it up
1237,Dr. Helen Cho, You have to get the Cradle to Stark
1238,Steve Rogers,First I have to find it
1239,Dr. Helen Cho,Go
1240,Steve Rogers,Did you guys copy that
1241,Clint Barton,We did
1242,Natasha Romanoff,"I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest"
1243,Natasha Romanoff, That could be him
1244,Clint Barton,There
1245,Clint Barton, It's a truck from the lab
1246,Clint Barton," Right above you, Cap"
1247,Clint Barton, On the loop by the bridge
1248,Clint Barton, It's them
1249,Clint Barton," I got three with the Cradle, one in the cab"
1250,Clint Barton, I could take out the driver
1251,Steve Rogers,Negative
1252,Steve Rogers," If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city"
1253,Steve Rogers, We need to draw out Ultron
1254,Ultron,"No, no, no, no, no"
1255,Ultron, Leave me alone
1256,Steve Rogers,"Well, he's definitely unhappy"
1257,Steve Rogers, I'm gonna try and keep him that way
1258,Clint Barton,"You're not a match for him, Cap"
1259,Steve Rogers,"Thanks, Barton"
1260,Ultron,You know what's in that Cradle
1261,Ultron," The power to make real change, and that terrifies you"
1262,Steve Rogers,I wouldn't call it a comfort
1263,Ultron,Stop it
1264,Clint Barton,We got a window
1265,Clint Barton," Four, threeâ€¦ give 'em hell"
1266,Natasha Romanoff,I'm always picking up after you boys
1267,Clint Barton,"They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot"
1268,Natasha Romanoff,Which way
1269,Clint Barton,Hard right
1270,Clint Barton, Now
1271,Natasha Romanoff,"Out of the way, coming through"
1272,Natasha Romanoff," Sorry, coming through"
1273,Steve Rogers,Come on
1274,Natasha Romanoff,"Clint, can you draw out the guards"
1275,Clint Barton,Let's find out
1276,Natasha Romanoff,Beep beep
1277,Clint Barton,Heading back towards you
1278,Clint Barton," So whatever youâ€™re gonna do, do it now"
1279,Natasha Romanoff,I'm going in
1280,Natasha Romanoff," Cap, can you keep him occupied"
1281,Steve Rogers,What do you think I've been doing
1282,Clint Barton,The package is airborne
1283,Clint Barton, I have a clean shot
1284,Natasha Romanoff,Negative
1285,Natasha Romanoff, I am still in the truck
1286,Clint Barton,What the hell are you
1287,Clint Barton,
1288,Natasha Romanoff,"Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you"
1289,Clint Barton,How do you want me to take it
1290,Natasha Romanoff,"Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that"
1291,Ultron,Please
1292,Ultron, Don't do this
1293,Wanda Maximoff,What choice do we have
1294,Steve Rogers,I lost him
1295,Steve Rogers, He's headed your way
1296,Clint Barton,"Nat, we gotta go"
1297,Clint Barton,Nat
1298,Clint Barton," Cap, you see Nat"
1299,Steve Rogers,"If you have the package, get it to Stark"
1300,Steve Rogers, Go
1301,Clint Barton,Do you have eyes on Nat
1302,Steve Rogers,Go
1303,Steve Rogers,  Civilians in our path
1304,Steve Rogers,  Can you stop this thing
1305,Pietro Maximoff,I'm fine
1306,Pietro Maximoff, I just need to take a minute
1307,Steve Rogers,I'm very tempted not to give you one
1308,Wanda Maximoff,"The Cradle, did you get it"
1309,Steve Rogers,Stark will take care of it
1310,Wanda Maximoff,"No, he won't"
1311,Steve Rogers,"You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy"
1312,Wanda Maximoff,He will do anything to make things right
1313,Steve Rogers,"Stark, come in"
1314,Steve Rogers, Stark
1315,Steve Rogers, Anyone on comms
1316,Wanda Maximoff,Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it
1317,Wanda Maximoff, Where do you think he gets that
1318,Bruce Banner,Anything on Nat
1319,Tony Stark,Haven't heard
1320,Tony Stark," But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it"
1321,Clint Barton,This is sealed tight
1322,Bruce Banner,"We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within"
1323,Tony Stark,Hm
1324,Tony Stark," Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff"
1325,Clint Barton,There's some nets I can cast
1326,Clint Barton," Yeah, alright"
1327,Clint Barton, I'll find her
1328,Bruce Banner,"I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted"
1329,Tony Stark,"Yeah, about that"
1330,Bruce Banner,No
1331,Tony Stark,You have to trust me
1332,Bruce Banner,Kinda don't
1333,Tony Stark,Our ally
1334,Tony Stark, The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes
1335,Tony Stark, I found him
1336,JARVIS,"Hello, Dr  Banner"
1337,Tony Stark,Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry
1338,Tony Stark, He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do
1339,Tony Stark, So JARVIS went underground
1340,Tony Stark, Okay
1341,Tony Stark," Scattered, dumped his memory"
1342,Tony Stark, But not his protocols
1343,Tony Stark," He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together"
1344,Bruce Banner,"So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing"
1345,Tony Stark,"No, of course not"
1346,Tony Stark, I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing
1347,Tony Stark,  We're out of my field here
1348,Tony Stark, You know bioorganics better than anyone
1349,Bruce Banner,And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's
1350,Tony Stark,JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it
1351,Tony Stark," This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality"
1352,Tony Stark, We have to
1353,JARVIS,I believe it's worth a go
1354,Bruce Banner,"No, I'm in a loop"
1355,Bruce Banner," I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong"
1356,Tony Stark,"I know, I know"
1357,Tony Stark," I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it"
1358,Tony Stark, We're mad scientists
1359,Tony Stark," We're monsters, buddy"
1360,Tony Stark, You gotta own it
1361,Tony Stark, Make a stand
1362,Tony Stark,  It's not a loop
1363,Tony Stark, It's the end of the line
1364,Ultron,I wasn't sure you'd wake up
1365,Ultron," I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something"
1366,Ultron, I don't have anyone else
1367,Ultron," I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them"
1368,Ultron, Boom
1369,Ultron," The end, start again"
1370,Ultron, The world made clean for the new man to rebuild
1371,Ultron, I was meant to be new
1372,Ultron, I was meant to be beautiful
1373,Ultron," The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy"
1374,Ultron, Instead they'll look up in horror because of you
1375,Ultron, You've wounded me
1376,Ultron, I give you full marks for that
1377,Ultron," But, like the man said, What doesn't kill meâ€¦  â€¦just makes me stronger"
1378,Tony Stark,This framework is not compatible
1379,Bruce Banner,The genetic coding tower's at ninetyseven percent
1380,Bruce Banner, You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes
1381,Steve Rogers,I'm gonna say this once
1382,Tony Stark,How about nonce
1383,Steve Rogers,Shut it down
1384,Tony Stark,"Nope, not gonna happen"
1385,Steve Rogers,You don't know what you're doing
1386,Bruce Banner,And you do
1387,Bruce Banner, She's not in your head
1388,Wanda Maximoff,I know you're angry
1389,Bruce Banner,"Oh, we're way past that"
1390,Bruce Banner, I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade
1391,Tony Stark,That's nothing compared to what's coming
1392,Wanda Maximoff,You don't know what's in there
1393,Pietro Maximoff,"No, no"
1394,Pietro Maximoff, Go on
1395,Pietro Maximoff, You were saying
1396,Wanda Maximoff,Pietro
1397,Clint Barton,What
1398,Clint Barton, You didn't see that coming
1399,Tony Stark,I'm rerouting the upload
1400,Bruce Banner,"Go ahead, piss me off"
1401,Bruce Banner,  Wait
1402,Vision,"I'm sorry, that was"
1403,Vision,odd
1404,Vision,  Thank you
1405,Steve Rogers,"Thor, you helped create this"
1406,Thor,I've had a vision
1407,Thor, A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at its center is that
1408,Bruce Banner,"What, the gem"
1409,Thor,It's the Mind Stone
1410,Thor," It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities"
1411,Steve Rogers,Then why would you bring it to
1412,Thor,Because Stark is right
1413,Bruce Banner,"Oh, it's definitely the end times"
1414,Thor,The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron
1415,Vision,Not alone
1416,Steve Rogers,Why does your vision sound like JARVIS
1417,Tony Stark,We
1418,Tony Stark, reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new
1419,Steve Rogers,I think I've had my fill of new
1420,Vision,You think I'm a child of Ultron
1421,Steve Rogers,You're not
1422,Vision,I'm not Ultron
1423,Vision, I'm not JARVIS
1424,Vision, I am
1425,Vision, I am
1426,Wanda Maximoff,I looked in your head and saw annihilation
1427,Vision,Look again
1428,Clint Barton,Yeah
1429,Clint Barton, Her seal of approval means jack to me
1430,Thor,"Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash"
1431,Thor, But with it on our side
1432,Steve Rogers,Is it
1433,Steve Rogers, Are you
1434,Steve Rogers, On our side
1435,Vision,I don't think it's that simple
1436,Clint Barton,Well it better get real simple real soon
1437,Vision,I am on the side of life
1438,Vision," Ultron isn't, he will end it all"
1439,Tony Stark,What's he waiting for
1440,Vision,You
1441,Bruce Banner,Where
1442,Clint Barton,Sokovia
1443,Clint Barton, He's got Nat there too
1444,Bruce Banner,"If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be"
1445,Vision,What will you do
1446,Vision,  I don't want to kill Ultron
1447,Vision," He's unique, and he's in pain"
1448,Vision," But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed"
1449,Vision," Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now"
1450,Vision, And not one of us can do it without the others
1451,Vision, Maybe I am a monster
1452,Vision, I don't think I'd know if I were one
1453,Vision," I'm not what you are, and not what you intended"
1454,Vision, So there may be no way to make you trust me
1455,Vision, But we need to go
1456,Thor,Right
1457,Thor,  Well done
1458,Steve Rogers,Three minutes
1459,Steve Rogers, Get what you need
1460,FRIDAY,"Good evening, boss"
1461,Tony Stark,No way we all get through this
1462,Tony Stark," If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost"
1463,Tony Stark, It's gonna be blood on the floor
1464,Steve Rogers,I got no plans tomorrow night
1465,Tony Stark,I get first crack at the big guy
1466,Tony Stark, Iron Man's the one he's waiting for
1467,Vision,"That's true, he hates you the most"
1468,Steve Rogers,Ultron knows we're coming
1469,Steve Rogers," Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for"
1470,Steve Rogers," But the people of Sokovia, they didn't"
1471,Steve Rogers, So our priority is getting them out
1472,Pietro Maximoff,We're under attack
1473,Pietro Maximoff," Clear the city, now"
1474,Pietro Maximoff,  Get off your asses
1475,Steve Rogers,"All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today"
1476,Steve Rogers, But we can do our best to protect them
1477,Steve Rogers," And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building"
1478,Steve Rogers," We find Romanoff, and we clear the field"
1479,Steve Rogers, Keep the fight between us
1480,Steve Rogers, Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world
1481,Steve Rogers, This isn't just about beating him
1482,Steve Rogers, It's about whether he's right
1483,Bruce Banner,Natasha
1484,Bruce Banner, Natasha
1485,Natasha Romanoff,Bruce
1486,Bruce Banner,You alright
1487,Natasha Romanoff,Yeah
1488,Bruce Banner,"The team's in the city, it's about to light up"
1489,Natasha Romanoff,I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere
1490,Bruce Banner,"Yeah, I did"
1491,Natasha Romanoff,So what's our play
1492,Bruce Banner,I'm here to get you to safety
1493,Natasha Romanoff,Job's not finished
1494,Bruce Banner,"We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians"
1495,Bruce Banner, And you've done plenty
1496,Bruce Banner, Our fight is over
1497,Natasha Romanoff,So we just disappear
1498,FRIDAY,"Your man's in the church, boss"
1499,FRIDAY, I think he's waiting for you
1500,Ultron,Come to confess your sins
1501,Tony Stark,"I don't know, how much time you got"
1502,Ultron,More than you
1503,Tony Stark,Uhhh
1504,Tony Stark, Have you been juicing
1505,Tony Stark, A little Vibranium cocktail
1506,Tony Stark," You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy"
1507,Ultron,You're stalling to protect the people
1508,Tony Stark,"Well, that is the mission"
1509,Tony Stark, Did you forget
1510,Ultron,I've moved beyond your mission
1511,Ultron, I'm free
1512,Ultron,"  What, you think you're the only one stalling"
1513,FRIDAY,There's the rest of the Vibranium
1514,Ultron,"This is how you end, Tony"
1515,Ultron, This is peace in my time
1516,Steve Rogers,Go
1517,Wanda Maximoff,Get off the bridge
1518,Wanda Maximoff, Run
1519,Vision,Ultron
1520,Ultron,My Vision
1521,Ultron, They really did take everything from me
1522,Vision,"You set the terms, you can change them"
1523,Ultron,Alright
1524,Tony Stark,FRIDAY
1525,Tony Stark, The Vision
1526,FRIDAY,"Boss, it's working"
1527,FRIDAY," He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there"
1528,Ultron,You shut me out
1529,Ultron, You think I care
1530,Ultron," You take away my world, I take away yours"
1531,Tony Stark,FRIDAY
1532,FRIDAY,Sokovia's going for a ride
1533,Ultron,Do you see
1534,Ultron," The beauty of it, the inevitability"
1535,Ultron," You rise, only to fall"
1536,Ultron," You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure"
1537,Ultron," Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me"
1538,Ultron, It means nothing
1539,Ultron," When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal"
1540,Bruce Banner,We gotta move
1541,Natasha Romanoff,You're not going to turn green
1542,Bruce Banner,I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool
1543,Natasha Romanoff,I adore you
1544,Natasha Romanoff,  But I need the other guy
1545,Natasha Romanoff,  Let's finish the job
1546,Natasha Romanoff,  I really hope this makes us even
1547,Natasha Romanoff, Now go be a hero
1548,FRIDAY,"The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together"
1549,Tony Stark,If it drops
1550,FRIDAY,Right now the impact would kill thousands
1551,Tony Stark,Hi
1552,Tony Stark, Okay
1553,Tony Stark, Get in the tub
1554,FRIDAY,"I got airborne, heading up to the bridge"
1555,Tony Stark,"Cap, you got incoming"
1556,Steve Rogers,Incoming already came in
1557,Steve Rogers," Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely"
1558,Clint Barton,"Go, go, move"
1559,Wanda Maximoff,How could I let this happen
1560,Clint Barton,"Hey, hey, you okay"
1561,Wanda Maximoff,This is all our fault
1562,Clint Barton,"Hey, look at me"
1563,Clint Barton," It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares"
1564,Clint Barton, Are you up for this
1565,Clint Barton, Are you
1566,Clint Barton," Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying"
1567,Clint Barton," Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow"
1568,Clint Barton, None of this makes sense
1569,Clint Barton, But I'm going back out there because it's my job
1570,Clint Barton, Okay
1571,Clint Barton, And I can't do my job and babysit
1572,Clint Barton," It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were"
1573,Clint Barton," If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill"
1574,Clint Barton," Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger"
1575,Clint Barton,"  Alright, good chat"
1576,Clint Barton,"  Yeah, the city is flying"
1577,Steve Rogers,I got you
1578,Steve Rogers, Just look at me
1579,Ultron,You can't save them all
1580,Steve Rogers,You'll never what
1581,Steve Rogers, You didn't finish
1582,Steve Rogers,"  What, were you napping"
1583,Ultron,Thor
1584,Ultron, You're bothering me
1585,Clint Barton,"Alright, we're all clear here"
1586,Steve Rogers,We are not clear
1587,Steve Rogers, We are very not clear
1588,Clint Barton,"Alright, coming to you"
1589,Pietro Maximoff,Keep up old man
1590,Clint Barton,Nobody would know
1591,Clint Barton, Nobody
1592,Clint Barton,"  The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him"
1593,Clint Barton, Uh
1594,Clint Barton,"yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard"
1595,Clint Barton, I miss him already
1596,Soldier,Hold your fire
1597,Steve Rogers,Romanoff
1598,Natasha Romanoff,Thanks
1599,FRIDAY,The antigravs are rigged to flip
1600,FRIDAY," Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust"
1601,FRIDAY, The city's not coming down slow
1602,Tony Stark,The spire's Vibranium
1603,Tony Stark, If I get Thor to hit it
1604,FRIDAY,"It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating"
1605,Tony Stark,"Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back"
1606,FRIDAY,"That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it"
1607,Steve Rogers,The next wave's gonna hit any minute
1608,Steve Rogers," What have you got, Stark"
1609,Tony Stark,"Well, nothing great"
1610,Tony Stark, Maybe a way to blow up the city
1611,Tony Stark, That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear
1612,Steve Rogers,"I asked for a solution, not an escape plan"
1613,Tony Stark,Impact radius is getting bigger every second
1614,Tony Stark, We're going to have to make a choice
1615,Natasha Romanoff,"Cap, these people are going nowhere"
1616,Natasha Romanoff, If Stark finds a way to blow this rock
1617,Steve Rogers,Not 'til everyone's safe
1618,Natasha Romanoff,Everyone up here versus everyone down there
1619,Natasha Romanoff, There's no math there
1620,Steve Rogers,I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it
1621,Natasha Romanoff,I didn't say we should leave
1622,Natasha Romanoff,  There's worse ways to go
1623,Natasha Romanoff, Where else am I gonna get a view like this
1624,Nick Fury,"Glad you like the view, Romanoff"
1625,Nick Fury, It's about to get better
1626,Nick Fury,"  Nice, right"
1627,Nick Fury, I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends
1628,Nick Fury," She's dusty, but she'll do"
1629,Steve Rogers,"Fury, you son of a bitch"
1630,Nick Fury,Oooh
1631,Nick Fury, You kiss your mother with that mouth
1632,Maria Hill,Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing
1633,Specialist Cameron Klein,Lifeboats secure to deploy
1634,Specialist Cameron Klein," Disengage in three, two"
1635,Specialist Cameron Klein, take 'em out
1636,Pietro Maximoff,This is SHIELD
1637,Steve Rogers,This is what SHIELD's supposed to be
1638,Pietro Maximoff,This is not so bad
1639,Steve Rogers,Let's load 'em up
1640,Maria Hill,"Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank"
1641,Nick Fury,Show 'em what we got
1642,Maria Hill,You're up
1643,James Rhodes,Yes
1644,James Rhodes, Now this is gonna be a good story
1645,Tony Stark,Yep
1646,Tony Stark, If you live to tell it
1647,James Rhodes,You think I can't hold my own
1648,Tony Stark,"We get through this, I'll hold your own"
1649,James Rhodes,You had to make it weird
1650,Clint Barton,"Alright, let's load 'em up"
1651,Clint Barton," Alright, here we go"
1652,Clint Barton," Here we go, let's move"
1653,Clint Barton, Let's go everyone
1654,Specialist Cameron Klein,Number six boat is topped and locked
1655,Specialist Cameron Klein," Or, uh, or stocked, topped"
1656,Specialist Cameron Klein, It
1657,Specialist Cameron Klein," it's, uh, full of people"
1658,Maria Hill,Incoming
1659,Specialist Cameron Klein,"Oh, God"
1660,Ultron,You think you're saving anyone
1661,Ultron, I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead
1662,Ultron, Even you can't stop that
1663,Thor,"I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am"
1664,Thor,running out of things to say
1665,Thor, Are you ready
1666,Vision,It's terribly well balanced
1667,Thor,"Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so"
1668,Tony Stark,I got it
1669,Tony Stark, Create a heat seal
1670,Tony Stark, I can
1671,Tony Stark,I can supercharge the spire from below
1672,FRIDAY,Running numbers
1673,FRIDAY,  A heat seal could work with enough power
1674,Tony Stark,"Thor, I got a plan"
1675,Thor,We're out of time
1676,Thor, They're coming for the core
1677,Tony Stark,"Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier"
1678,James Rhodes,On it
1679,Tony Stark,"Avengers, time to work for a living"
1680,Pietro Maximoff,You good
1681,Wanda Maximoff,Yeah
1682,Tony Stark,Romanoff
1683,Tony Stark, You and Banner better not be playing hide the zucchini
1684,Natasha Romanoff,"Relax, Shellhead"
1685,Natasha Romanoff, Not all of us can fly
1686,Natasha Romanoff,  What's the drill
1687,Tony Stark,This is the drill
1688,Tony Stark," If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose"
1689,Thor,Is that the best you can do
1690,Steve Rogers,You had to ask
1691,Ultron,This is the best I can do
1692,Ultron, This is exactly what I wanted
1693,Ultron," All of you, against all of me"
1694,Ultron, How could you possibly hope to stop me
1695,Tony Stark,"Well, like the old man said"
1696,Tony Stark, Together
1697,Thor,They'll try to leave the city
1698,Tony Stark,"We can't let 'em, not even one"
1699,Tony Stark, Rhodey
1700,James Rhodes,I'm on it
1701,James Rhodes,"  Oh, no, I didn't say you could leave"
1702,James Rhodes," War Machine, comin' at you, right  Okay, what"
1703,Steve Rogers,We gotta move out
1704,Steve Rogers, Even I can tell the air is getting thin
1705,Steve Rogers," You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you"
1706,Clint Barton,What about the core
1707,Wanda Maximoff,I'll protect it
1708,Wanda Maximoff, It's my job
1709,Wanda Maximoff,  Get the people on the boats
1710,Pietro Maximoff,I'm not going to leave you here
1711,Wanda Maximoff,I can handle this
1712,Wanda Maximoff,"  Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before"
1713,Pietro Maximoff,Hmm
1714,Wanda Maximoff,You understand
1715,Pietro Maximoff,"You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you"
1716,Wanda Maximoff,Go
1717,FRIDAY,"Boss, power levels are way below opt"
1718,Tony Stark,Reroute everything
1719,Tony Stark, We get one shot at this
1720,Clint Barton,I know what I need to do
1721,Clint Barton, The dining room
1722,Clint Barton," If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh"
1723,Clint Barton," Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think"
1724,Natasha Romanoff,You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway
1725,Clint Barton,No one eats in a dining room
1726,Clint Barton,  We don't have a lot of time
1727,Natasha Romanoff,So get your ass on a boat
1728,Natasha Romanoff,"  Hey, big guy"
1729,Natasha Romanoff, Sun's getting real low
1730,Zrinka,Costel
1731,Zrinka, We were in the market
1732,Zrinka, Costel
1733,Zrinka,
1734,Tony Stark,"Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church"
1735,Thor,Is this the last of them
1736,Steve Rogers,Yeah
1737,Steve Rogers, Everyone else is on the carrier
1738,Tony Stark,"You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away"
1739,Thor,Maybe not
1740,Ultron,"I got no strings, so I have fun"
1741,Ultron, I'm not tied up to anyone
1742,Pietro Maximoff,You didn't see that coming
1743,Ultron,"Oh, for God's sake"
1744,Clint Barton,"No, no"
1745,Clint Barton, I'm fine
1746,Clint Barton,"  Oh, it's been a long day"
1747,Ultron,Wanda
1748,Ultron," If you stay here, you'll die"
1749,Wanda Maximoff,I just did
1750,Wanda Maximoff, Do you know how it felt
1751,Wanda Maximoff,  It felt like that
1752,Tony Stark,"Thor, on my mark"
1753,Tony Stark,  Now
1754,Natasha Romanoff,"Hey, big guy"
1755,Natasha Romanoff," We did it, the job's finished"
1756,Natasha Romanoff," Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay"
1757,Natasha Romanoff," We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out"
1758,Vision,You're afraid
1759,Ultron,Of you
1760,Vision,Of death
1761,Vision, You're the last one
1762,Ultron,You were supposed to be the last
1763,Ultron," Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave"
1764,Vision,I suppose we're both disappointments
1765,Ultron,I suppose we are
1766,Vision,Humans are odd
1767,Vision," They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be"
1768,Vision, But there is grace in their failings
1769,Vision, I think you missed that
1770,Ultron,They're doomed
1771,Vision,Yes
1772,Vision, But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts
1773,Vision, It's a privilege to be among them
1774,Ultron,You're unbearably naive
1775,Vision,"Well, I was born yesterday"
1776,Laura Barton,Say hi to Auntie Nat
1777,Natasha Romanoff,Fat
1778,Nick Fury,"One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea"
1779,Nick Fury, Could be the Quinjet
1780,Nick Fury," But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing"
1781,Natasha Romanoff,Right
1782,Nick Fury,Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji
1783,Nick Fury, He'll send a postcard
1784,Natasha Romanoff,Wish you were here
1785,Natasha Romanoff," You sent me to recruit him, way back when"
1786,Natasha Romanoff, Did you know then what was going to happen
1787,Nick Fury,You never know
1788,Nick Fury, You hope for the best and make do with what you get
1789,Nick Fury, I got a great team
1790,Natasha Romanoff,Nothing lasts forever
1791,Nick Fury,"Trouble, Miss Romanoff"
1792,Nick Fury," No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around"
1793,Steve Rogers,The rules have changed
1794,Tony Stark,We're dealing with something new
1795,Steve Rogers,"Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence"
1796,Tony Stark,A machine
1797,Steve Rogers,So it doesn't count
1798,Tony Stark,No
1799,Tony Stark, It's not like a person lifting the hammer
1800,Steve Rogers,Right
1801,Steve Rogers, Different rules for us
1802,Tony Stark,"Nice guy, but artificial"
1803,Steve Rogers,Thank you
1804,Thor,"If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone"
1805,Thor," It's safe with the Vision and these days, safe is in short supply"
1806,Steve Rogers,But if you put the hammer in an elevator
1807,Tony Stark,It would still go up
1808,Steve Rogers,Elevator's not worthy
1809,Thor,I'm going to miss these little talks of ours
1810,Tony Stark,"Well, not if you don't leave"
1811,Thor,I have no choice
1812,Thor, The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years
1813,Thor, That's not a coincidence
1814,Thor, Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us
1815,Thor, But once all these pieces are in position
1816,Tony Stark,Triple Yahtzee
1817,Steve Rogers,You think you can find out what's coming
1818,Thor,I do
1819,Thor,"  Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained"
1820,Tony Stark,That man has no regard for lawn maintenance
1821,Tony Stark, I'm gonna miss him though
1822,Tony Stark, And you're gonna miss me
1823,Tony Stark, There's gonna be a lot of manful tears
1824,Steve Rogers,"I will miss you, Tony"
1825,Tony Stark,Yeah
1826,Tony Stark," Well, it's time for me to tap out"
1827,Tony Stark," Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up"
1828,Steve Rogers,The simple life
1829,Tony Stark,You'll get there one day
1830,Steve Rogers,"I don't know, family, stability"
1831,Steve Rogers, The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventyfive years ago
1832,Steve Rogers, I think someone else came out
